## Before you begin

- Have you registered to begin using Payment Links? Contact your Solution Engineer or <ExternalLink href="mailto:integration@checkout.com">integration@checkout.com</ExternalLink>. During integration, you'll be able to specify your payment capture and 3D Secure settings.
- You can set up [webhooks](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks) to be notified when the payment has been approved, so you can continue the sales fulfilment flow.
- To practise API calls <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >request a test account</ExternalLink> and use the Sandbox version of the endpoint.

## Create a Payment Link

### Step 1: Create a new Payment Link session

When requesting a payment from a customer using Payment Links solution, you can create a Payment Links session. This can be sent to the customer through a method that best suits you.

To get a detailed view of all required and optional fields, see our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/" >API reference</ExternalLink>.

<TipBox variant="success">

You can provide a `return_url` in your API request. Once their payment is confirmed, the customer will be redirected to wherever the link is directed to. This could be back to your website, for example.

http://localhost/ can only be used for the URL fields during testing and will not work in production.

### Response example

```json
{
  "id": "pl_ELqQJXdXzabU",
  "reference": "ORD-123A",
  "expires_on": "2020-08-20T20:25:28+08:00",
  "_links": {
    "redirect": {
      "href": "https://pay.sandbox.checkout.com/link/pl_ELqQJXdXzabU"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Send the link to your customer

Send the Payment Link you received in the `\_links.redirect` object of the above response to your customer.

This could be by email, text message, social media, live chatâ€”wherever your customer wants to pay.

When they visit the link, they will be presented with a Checkout.com-hosted payment page to complete their payment. Once they have completed the payment, they will be redirected to a Checkout.com-hosted confirmation page. The button at the bottom of the page redirects the customer to the specified URL only if you provide a `return_url` when creating a Payment Link, so make sure you include it in your API request.

---

## Check the status of a Payment Link

To keep track of the payments you request through Payment Links, you can check the status using the id returned when you created the session. It will look like `pl_ELqQJXdXzabU`.

There are three statuses:

- `Active`: The Payment Link can accept a payment from the customer. A payment may have been attempted by the customer but not completed successfully.
- `Payment Received`: A payment has been received successfully using this Payment Link.
- `Expired`: The Payment Link has expired and can no longer be accessed.
