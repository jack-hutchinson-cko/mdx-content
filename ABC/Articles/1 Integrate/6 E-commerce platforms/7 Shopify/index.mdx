The Checkout.com payment gateway is fully integrated with Shopify. If you're already using Shopify, you can start accepting payments through our gateway by configuring a few simple settings.

On this page, we will walk through: 
* [Setting up the integration](#Set_up_your_integration)
* [Creating redirects and webhooks](#Create_redirects_and_webhooks)

## Before you begin

If you haven't already, <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >create a test Checkout.com account</ExternalLink> to test this integration.

## Choose either the on-site or off-site integration option

We provide two Shopify integration methods:

* [On site](#On-site_integration), where your customer enters their payment details on your website. 
* [Off site](#Off-site_integration), where they will be redirected to a Checkout.com page to do so.

## Create redirects and webhooks

When a customer submits a payment, they are taken to a payment success or a payment error screen. You need to set up redirects so we know where to send the customer when these events happen. In this section, we will walk through how to do this, as well as creating webhook notifications so you are kept informed about a payments timeline.

### Create redirects

1. From the Hub, navigate to _Settings > Channels_.
2. Navigate to the _URLs_ section and paste in the following URLs (depending on your environment).

<tabs>
<tab title="Sandbox">
