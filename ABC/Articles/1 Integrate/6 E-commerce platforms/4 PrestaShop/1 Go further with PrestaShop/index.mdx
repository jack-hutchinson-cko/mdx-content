2.  Find the Checkout.com plugin, select _Configure_ and go to _Card payments_.
3.  Set _Use 3D Secure_ to _Yes_.

## Card payment options

### Manually capture payments

1.  Log in to your PrestaShop admin dashboard, and go to _Modules > Modules Manager_.
2.  Find the Checkout.com plugin, and select _Configure_.
3.  Set _Payment Action_ to _Authorize_. This will only authorize the charge; you will now have to manually capture the payment yourself.
4.  Select _Save_.

### Delay payment capture

1.  Sign in to your PrestaShop admin dashboard, and go to _Modules > Modules Manager_.
2.  Find the Checkout.com plugin, and select _Configure_.
3.  Make sure you've set _Payment Action_ to _Authorize and Capture_.
4.  Specify the _Capture Time_. By default, this is blank, meaning the charge will be authorized and captured at the same time. If you want to delay the payment's capture, you can set the period of delay (in hours) here (e.g., `1` = payment captured after one hour; `1.5` = payment captured after one hour and 30 minutes).
5.  Select _Save_.

### Enable dynamic descriptor

This is an extra field that you can send to the issuer, appearing on the customer's bank statement as an additional description of the payment.

1.  Sign in to your PrestaShop admin dashboard, and go to _Modules > Modules Manager_.
2.  Find the Checkout.com plugin, and select _Configure_.
3.  Set _Enable Dynamic Descriptor_ to _Yes_.
4.  Specify your _Descriptor Name_. This is the first line of the descriptor, usually your merchant name.
5.  Specify your _Descriptor City_. This is the second line of the descriptor, usually the city of your merchant address.
6.  Select _Save_.

### Enable saved cards

This setting allows your customers to save their cards for future payments. They can then use the same card on your website without re-entering the details.

1.  Sign in to your PrestaShop admin dashboard, and go to _Modules > Modules Manager_.
2.  Find the Checkout.com plugin, select _Configure_ and go to _Card payments_.
3.  Set _Save Card Option_ to _Yes_.
4.  Select _Save_.

### Enable Mada BIN check

Mada is a local card scheme in Saudi Arabia. When enabled, we check the card's BIN to see if the customer is using a Mada card, and then apply the necessary configuration before sending the payment request.

Take a look at our [Mada guide](/payments/payment-methods/cards/mada) to find out more.

1.  Sign in to your PrestaShop admin dashboard, and go to _Modules > Modules Manager_.
2.  Find the Checkout.com plugin, select _Configure_ and go to _Card payments_.
3.  Set _Enable MADA BIN Check_ to _Yes_.
4.  Select _Save_.

## Order statuses

These settings allow you edit the order statuses in line with the status of the payment. But they are automatically set to PrestaShop's default values, so it's unlikely you will need to edit them.

To find these settings, log in to your PrestaShop admin dashboard, go to _Modules > Modules Manager_, find the Checkout.com plugin, select _Configure_ and then scroll down.
