## Accept recurring payments via the WooCommerce Subscriptions extension

Recurring payments allows you to enable shopper interactions for scheduled payments like subscription payments.

<TipBox variant="note">

To be able to use this feature, you must be using WooCommerce Subscriptions to manage subscriptions within WooCommerce. See <ExternalLink href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/store-manager-guide/#section-1" >WooCommerce Subscriptions Store Manager Guide</ExternalLink>.

</TipBox>

The Checkout.com WooCommerce plugin registers with payment events triggered by <ExternalLink href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/?quid=5e8af87e904d140455ce35c27943f7ce" >WooCommerce Subscriptions</ExternalLink> to support the following actions:

- Cancellation of a subscription
- Suspension of a subscription
- Re-activation of a subscription
- Change of amount for a subscription
- Change of date for a subscription
- Management of multiple subscriptions

To find these settings:

1. Log into your Wordpress admin dashboard.
2. Go to _WooCommerce > Settings > Payments_.
3. Find the Checkout.com plugin.
4. Select _Manage_ and then _Order Settings_.
