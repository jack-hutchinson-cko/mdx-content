</TipBox>

## Before you start

### Create a test account

If you haven't already, <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >create a test Checkout.com account</ExternalLink>.

### Get your API keys

In order to set up WooCommerce, you'll need three API keys: a secret one, a public one, and a private shared one. The first two are generated automatically upon account creation. The last one is generated when you configure a webhook for your business.

<TipBox variant="info">

You do not need your private shared key if using v4.2.0+ of our WooCommerce plugin.

</TipBox>

1.  Log in to your test account on the <ExternalLink href="https://sandbox.checkout.com/" >Hub sandbox</ExternalLink>.
2.  In the left menu, go to _Settings > Channels_, and make a note of your secret and public API keys.

3.  Scroll down to the _Webhooks_ section of the page and select _New webhook_.
4.  Enter the following endpoint URL, replacing `example.com` with the URL of your shop: `example.com/?wc-api=wc_checkoutcom_webhook`. **Note**: Correctly configuring your webhooks is important; if they're incorrectly formatted, the plugin will not work.
5.  Select  _API - v2.0_.
6.  Tick  _Select all_, then select _Create webhook_.

7.  Select the webhook you just created, and make a note of the private shared API key.

<TipBox variant="info">

Webhooks are notifications that we send when an event occurs on your account. For example, when a payment is captured. These are used by the WooCommerce plugin to update the status of an order. [Read more about webhooks](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks).

</TipBox>

### Check you have no previous version of the plugin

1.  Log in to WordPress as an administrator.
2.  In the left menu, select _Plugins_.
3.  Look for any plugins that have Checkout.com in the name. If you find one, select _Delete_, or select _Deactivate_ and then _Delete_.
