From downloading the plugin to requesting your first test payment, learn how to get started with the Checkout.com for Magento 2 plugin.

<TipBox variant="note">

This guide assumes that you have Magento (the plugin is compatible with version 2.2.8 and above) installed. In addition, you will need to be on a dedicated server, or have the enterprise version of Magento, to use this plugin.

</TipBox>
<TipBox variant="info" title="Magento 2 storefront integration">

If you're building a storefront on top of a headless Magento 2 backend, install our Magento 2 plugin as set out below, and then [follow this guide](/integrate/e-commerce-platforms/magento-2/storefront-integration).

## Before you start

### Create a test account

If you haven't already, <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >create a test Checkout.com account</ExternalLink>.

### Get your API keys

To set up our Magento 2 plugin, you'll need three API keys: a secret one, a public one, and a private shared one. The first two are generated automatically upon account creation. The last one is generated when you create a webhook for your business.

<TipBox variant="info">

Webhooks are notifications that we send when an event occurs on your account. For example, when a payment is captured. These are used by the Magento plugin to update the status of an order. [Read more about webhooks](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks).

</TipBox>

1. Log in to your test account on the <ExternalLink href="https://sandbox.checkout.com/" >Hub sandbox</ExternalLink>.
2. In the left menu, go to _Settings > Channels_, and make a note of your secret and public API keys.

<Accordion title="Manual webhook creation">

1. Scroll down to the _Webhooks_ section of the page and select _New webhook_.
2. Enter the following URL, replacing `example.com` with the URL of your shop: `example.com/checkout_com/webhook/callback`. (A webhook URL specific to your installation is available in the Account Settings section of the plugin configuration panel.)

<TipBox variant="note">

Correctly configuring your webhooks is important; if they're incorrectly formatted, the plugin will not work.

</TipBox>

3. Select _API - v2.0_.
4. Tick _Select all_, then select _Create webhook_.

5. Select the webhook you just created, and make a note of the private shared API key.

## Install plugin

There are two ways to install the plugin:

- [Using Composer](#Using_composer)
- [Using Magento Marketplace](#Using_magento_marketplace)

### Using Composer

<TipBox variant="info">

We recommend this method, as it should install the latest version of the plugin.

</TipBox>

1. Go to the root directory of your Magento 2 server.
2. Use one of the following commands:
   - `composer require checkoutcom/magento2`
   - `composer require checkoutcom/magento2:<VERSION_NUMBER>`
3. You should get a success message confirming the installation of Checkout.com php sdk and Checkout.com plugin.
4. The plugin is now installed, but you need to recompile your Magento 2 installation and clear the cache before configuring it. Type the following commands in turn:
  - `php bin/magento setup:upgrade`
  - `rm -rf var/cache var/generation/ var/di`
  - `php bin/magento setup:di:compile`
  - `php bin magento cache:clean`

### Using Magento Marketplace

1. <ExternalLink href="https://marketplace.magento.com/checkoutcom-magento2.html" >Purchase the extension from Magento Marketplace, it's free</ExternalLink>.
2. Follow the installation instructions on the checkout page.
3. Once you've installed the extension, log in to your Magento Admin Panel and go to _Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods_. If successful, you should now see Checkout.com on the list.

You're now ready to configure the Magento 2 plugin.

---

## Configure the plugin

1. Log in to your Magento Admin Panel and go to _Stores > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods_.
2. Find the Checkout.com plugin and select _Configure_.
3. In this configuration panel, go to _Configuration > Global Settings_.
4. Make sure _Environment_ is set to _Test_ so you can start testing card payments.

<img

  src="/docs/Integrate/Magento 2/Magento_2_plugin_global_settings.png"
  title="Magento 2 plugin global settings"
/>

5. Select the _Payment Action_.
  * _Authorize and Capture_ means that the charge is authorized and captured (i.e., the money due from the customer's account is moved into your account) at the same time.
  * _Authorize_ will only authorize the charge; you have to manually capture the payment yourself.
  * If you're unsure, _Authorize and Capture_ is likely the right choice.
6. Then go to _Account Settings_.
7. Enter your _Secret Key_ and _Public Key_. If you're testing, make sure you use the API keys from your sandbox Hub account, then select _Set Webhooks_ to automatically register your webhooks in <ExternalLink href="https://checkout.com/" >Checkout.com</ExternalLink> Hub.

8. Select _Save Config_.

That's it! You're ready to start testing card payments.

## Test your integration

1. Go to your storefront and add a product to your cart.
2. Go to your cart and proceed to the checkout.
3. Enter the required billing details. You can put anything here, though we recommend using a real email address so you can receive the order confirmation.
4. Select the _Pay by Card with Checkout.com_ method.
5. Enter the following card details:

- Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiry date: `12/25`
- CVV: `100`

6. Select _Place order_, and you will be redirected to the order confirmation page. If you entered a real email address in the billing details, you'll also receive an order confirmation email.
7. Log in to your Magento Admin Panel.
8. Go to _Sales > Orders_. Your test order will be displayed there with a `Processing` status (or `Pending Payment` if you choose the Authorize only payment action). This indicates that the payment has been successfully captured. The transaction will also appear in the _Payments_ section of your sandbox Hub account.

You can now either [go live](#Go_live) as-is or [extend your configuration](#Extend_your_configuration).

<TipBox variant="note" title="Troubleshooting">

If this test does not work, first check you have configured your webhooks correctly. For the plugin to work, they must be formatted correctly. If you have configured them properly, check your server; if it's password-protected or it restricts unfamiliar IP addresses, it may be blocking webhook notifications. Contact our Integration team at <ExternalLink href="mailto:integration@checkout.com">integration@checkout.com</ExternalLink> if you need help.

</TipBox>
<TipBox variant="info" title="Further testing">

You'll find more test cards and a range of scenarios to trigger in our [testing guide](/testing).

## Go live

If you're happy with the outcome of your testing and want to start taking payments right away, please <ExternalLink href="https://checkout.com/contact-sales" >contact our Sales team</ExternalLink> in order to move to a live account.

<TipBox variant="note">

Before you go live, remember to:

- Switch the environment to Production in the plugin's settings.
- Update your public, secret and private shared API keys in the plugin's settings with the keys from your live Hub account.
- Configure the webhook URLs in your live Hub account.

</TipBox>
