## Enable 3D Secure payments

<TipBox variant="note">

If you enable this feature, every transaction will trigger a 3D Secure (3DS) check. If you only want to trigger 3DS authentication for certain transactions, contact your customer success manager.

</TipBox>

1.  Log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand _Card Payments_.
2.  Make sure Enable Card Payments is set to _Yes_.
3.  Set Use 3D Secure to _Yes_.
4.  Select whether you want to Attempt non-3D Secure transactions. If you select _Yes_, any cards that do not support 3DS will go through without a 3DS check. If you select _No_, cards that do no support 3DS will be blocked.
5.  Select _Save Config_.

---

## Enable payments with saved cards

1.  Log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand _Card Payments_.
2.  Set _Save Card Option_ to _Yes_ if you want to allow your customers to save their cards for future payments. They can then use the same card on your website without re-entering the details.
3.  Next, expand _Saved Card Payments_.

<img src="/docs/Integrate/Magento 2/saved_card_payments.png" title="Saved Card Payments"  />

4.  Set _Vault Enabled_ to _Yes_.
5.  Specify the _Title_ customers see when they choose to pay with a saved card.
6.  Set _Use 3D Secure_ to _Yes_ if you want saved cards to go through 3D Secure authentication.
7.  Select whether or not you want to Attempt non-3D Secure transactions for saved cards. If you select _Yes_, any saved cards that do not support 3DS will go through without a 3DS check. If you select _No_, saved cards that do no support 3DS will be blocked.
8.  Set _Require CVV for saved cards_ to _Yes_ if you want the customer to enter the three (or four) digit CVV when they pay with a saved card. This provides additional security against fraud. Select _No_ if you're happy for the customer to pay with a saved card without entering the card's CVV.
9.  Select _Save Config_.

## Enable MOTO payments

These settings allow the administrator of your account to carry out mail order / telephone order (MOTO) payments on your customers' behalf.

1.  Log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand _MOTO Payments_.

3.  Specify what _Title_ you want your customers to see when they select the MOTO payment option.
4.  Set _Saved Cards Enabled_ to _Yes_ if you want to allow your administrator to make MOTO payments using customers' saved cards.

## Card payment options

To find these settings, log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand _Card Payments_.

### Payment option title

Allows you to specify what title the customer will see when they choose to pay by card.

### Display card icons

Set to _Yes_ if you want to display card scheme logos to customers, and then select the particular scheme logos you want to display.

### Enable Mada BIN check

<TipBox variant="note">

Mada cards always require a CVV check, so make sure you set the _Require CVV for saved cards_ option to _Yes_ in the Card Payments settings. This will ensure that the customer is asked to enter the CVV when they make a payment with a saved Mada card.

</TipBox>

Mada is a local card scheme in Saudi Arabia. If you are going to be processing Mada cards, you should set _Enable MADA Bin Check_ to _Yes_.

When enabled, we check the card's BIN to see if the customer is using a Mada card, and then apply the necessary configuration before sending the payment request.

Enabling this feature will also mean all Mada card payment are auto-capture and 3DS authentication for requests.

Take a look at our [Mada guide](/payments/payment-methods/cards/mada) to find out more.

### Payment form layout

Select your preferred layout for the payment form. _Single iframe_ displays a one-line payment form. _Multiple iframes_ displays a payment form of three fields. See our [Frames customization guide](/integrate/frames/frames-customization-guide) for more information.

### Payment form styles

Allows you to customize the payment form's look and feel. You can add CSS styles in JSON format to alter the form's appearance. For example: `{"base":{"color":"blue","fontSize":"18px"}}`. See our [Frames customization guide](/integrate/frames/frames-customization-guide) for more information.

## General payment options

To find these settings, log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand _Global Settings_.

### Payment action

If you want to manually capture payments, rather than have payments automatically captured (the _Authorize_ and _Capture_ option), set _Payment Action_ to _Authorize_. Payments will now be authorized, but you will need to manually capture the payment afterwards.

### Capture time

If you set the _Authorize_ and _Capture_ as the _Payment Action_, you can use this setting to specify the delay (in hours) before the payment is captured. For example, `1.500` for capture after one hour and 30 minutes; `0.02` for capture after 72 seconds. We don't recommend setting a value lower than `0.02` (72 seconds).

### Dynamic descriptor

This is an extra field that you can send to the issuer, appearing on the customer's bank statement as an additional description of the payment.

1.  Set _Enable Dynamic Descriptor_ to _Yes_ if you want to send this extra information. If not enabled, the shopper will just see your merchant name as it appears in your Hub account.
2.  Specify the _Descriptor Name_. This is the first line of the descriptor, usually your merchant name. You can use up to 25 characters.
3.  Specify the _Descriptor City_. This is the second line of the descriptor, usually the city of your merchant address. You can use up to 13 characters.

## Manually capture, void and refund payments

As well as doing so through the Hub, you can also manually capture, void, and refund payments from the Magento Admin Panel. These actions will show in both Magento and the Hub.

### Manually capture payment

1.  Log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand _Global Settings_.
2.  Make sure _Payment Action_ is set to _Authorize_.
3.  Once you've created an order, find it in _Sales > Orders_ in your Magento Admin Panel. It should have a `Pending Payment` status. Select _View_ on the order.
4.  Select _Invoice_.
5.  Select _Submit Invoice_ at the bottom of the page to complete and capture the payment.

### Void payment

<TipBox variant="note">

You can only void payments that have been authorized but not yet captured.

</TipBox>

1.  Log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand _Global Settings_.
2.  Make sure _Payment Action_ is set to _Authorize_.
3.  Once you've created an order, find it in _Sales > Orders_ in your Magento Admin Panel. It should have a `Pending Payment` status. Select _View_ on the order.
4.  Select _Void_ to void the payment.

### Refund a payment

<TipBox variant="note">

If refunding through Magento, we recommend you do so through the invoice for the order, rather than selecting _Credit Memo_ from the order view. The latter only gives you a _Refund offline_ option, which will not record the refund in your Hub account.

</TipBox>

1.  Once you've created an order, log in to your Magento Admin Panel and find the order in _Sales > Orders_.
2.  If the payment wasn't captured automatically on authorization, capture the payment now. A captured payment will have a `Processing` status.
3.  Select _View_ on the order.
4.  From the Invoices section of the order, select _Credit Memo_.
5.  Select the products you want to refund and select _Refund_ (not Refund offline).

## Order settings

To find these settings, log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go to the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel, select _Configuration_ and then expand _Order Settings_.

### Action on failed payment

Select the action you want to be taken on orders with failed payments. We recommend you choose _Cancel the order_. This will cancel the order where the payment fails, but still record it so you have a trace of all failed orders. If you choose _Delete the order_, it will delete any trace of the failed order, leaving no record of it.

### Order confirmation email

Select at what point you want to send the customer an order confirmation email. _Authorize_ will send an order confirmation email to the customer as soon as the payment is authorized. _Authorize and Capture_ will send it only after the payment has been both authorized and captured.

### Order statuses

These settings allow you edit the order statuses in line with the status of the payment. But they are automatically set to Magento's default values, so be aware that editing them may cause problems with the order flow.
