### Apple Pay

<TipBox variant="info">

Before going through these steps, you need to [set up and configure Apple Pay](/payments/payment-methods/wallets/apple-pay/set-up-apple-pay).

</TipBox>

1. Sign in to Business Manager.
2. Go to _Merchant Tools > Ordering > Payment Methods_.
3. Set _Enable_ to _Yes for CHECKOUTCOM_APPLE_PAY_ and save the changes.
4. Go to _Merchant Tools > Site Preferences > Apple Pay_.
5. Choose in which environment you want to run Apple Pay: Test or Production.
6. Check the _Apple Pay Enabled?_ option.
7. Enter your Apple Merchant ID and Apple Merchant Name. You'll find these in your Apple Developer account.
8. Enter the country code_ (the [two-letter ISO 3166 country code](/resources/codes/country-codes)) for your site's locale.
9. Check the _3DS_ option in _Merchant Capabilities_, leaving the other options unchecked.
10. Select _Supported Networks_.
11. Select the _Required Shipping Address_ fields.

14. Select whether to enable the automatic redirect of product detail pages to HTTPS.

<TipBox variant="info">

Pages where the Apple Pay button appears must be served via HTTPS, so you might need to redirect certain pages on your site.

</TipBox>

15. Select _Submit_. A domain name should appear in the Registration section. If you don't have an alias registered for your site, you'll see a domain similar like `staging-merchant.demandware.net` or `production-merchant.demandware.net`. If you do have an alias registered, the domain will be something like `mystore.com`.
16. Register your site with the Apple sandbox or production server. You only need one merchant ID to register with both servers. If your domain is registered with Apple sandbox, only devices signed in to an <ExternalLink href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-connect/" >iCloud Sandbox Tester Account</ExternalLink> can make payments on that site. If your domain is registered with the Apple production server, any regular iCloud account can pay on that site.

## Enable 3D Secure payments

Activate this feature if you want your transactions to be [3D Secure (3DS) authenticated](/risk-management/3d-secure). (Our SFCC plugin supports 3DS2, the new authentication standard.)

<TipBox variant="note">

If you enable this feature, **every** transaction will trigger a 3DS check. If you only want to trigger it for certain transactions, contact your Customer Success manager.

</TipBox>

1.  Log in to Business Manager.
2.  Go to _Merchant Tools > Site Preferences > Custom Preferences > Checkout.com Global Settings_.
3.  Set _3D Secure_ to _Yes_.
4.  Select whether or not you want to _Attempt Non 3D Secure transactions_. If you select _Yes_, any cards that do not support 3DS will go through without a 3DS check. If you select _No_, cards that do no support 3DS will be blocked.
5.  Select _Save_.
