## Enable 3D Secure payments

1.  Go to card payments.
2.  If you want to process all payments as 3D Secure payments, set _Use 3D Secure_ to _True_.
3.  Select whether you want to _Attempt non-3D Secure transactions_. If you select _True_, any cards that do not support 3DS will go through without a 3DS check. If you select _False_, cards that do no support 3DS will be blocked.

This add-on is compliant with the 3DS 2.0 (PSD2) directive. In case of a non-frictionless interaction, where the user is required to enter additional information related to the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), the user will be sent to our hosted solution page. Read our [3DS documentation](/risk-management/3d-secure) for more information.
