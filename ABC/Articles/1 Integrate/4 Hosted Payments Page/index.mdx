Accept card payments with a Hosted Payments Page—a fast and easy way to collect your customer’s payment information, process the payment request and handle authentication. We've created a table that lists [supported payment methods](/integrate/product-support), languages and other features.

<TipBox variant="info">

Hosted Payments Page now supports six more payment methods.

</TipBox>

---

## How it works

When your customer is ready to check out:

1. Create a Hosted Payments Page session and pass through all the payment information, like the amount, currency, country and reference.
2. We'll use this information to render the Hosted Payments Page to which you will redirect your customer to make their payment.
3. Once your customer fills in the required payment details, we will process the payment and handle the authentication flow.
4. And after the payment has been successfully processed, you will be notified by a [webhook](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks).

### Response example

The response will include the `redirect` link to which you should redirect your customer to finalize the payment.

```json
{
  "reference": "ORD-123A",
  "_links": {
    "redirect": {
      "href": "https://pay.sandbox.checkout.com/page/hpp_xGQBg0AXl3cM"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Redirect your customer

Redirect the customer to the `\_links.redirect` URL you received in the response above, using either a server-side or client-side call.

<tabs>
<tab title="Server-side redirect">

```json
res.redirect(hostedPaymentsResponse._links.redirect.href);
```

</tab>
<tab title="Client-side redirect">

```json
window.location.href(hostedPaymentsResponse._links.redirect.href);
```

</tab>
</tabs>

### Step 4: Confirm the payment status

When your customer completes the payment, they will be redirected to the `success_url`. The `session ID` or `payment ID` is provided in the query parameter included in the redirect URL. It should look something either of the links below:

- `http://example.com/success?cko-session-id=sid_ubfj2q76miwundwlk72vxt2i7`
- `http://example.com/success?cko-payment-id=pay_mbabizu24mvu3mela5njyhpit4`

You can set up [webhooks](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks) to be notified when the payment has been approved to continue the sales fulfilment flow.
