## Test keys

Always use your test keys when testing your integration, this is how we know to link all test payments to your sandbox account. You can find your test keys in our <ExternalLink href="https://sandbox.checkout.com" >sandbox version of the Hub</ExternalLink> under your channel settings. Test keys use the prefix `sk_test` and `pk_test`.
