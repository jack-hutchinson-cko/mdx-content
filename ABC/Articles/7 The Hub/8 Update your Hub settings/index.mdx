## About user roles

The Hub comes with three pre-defined roles: administrator owner, administrator, and user. The administrator owner is the initial administrator for the account.

Each role comes with its own set of permissions, as described in the table below.

## Manage the channel settings

The Channels section is where administrators can manage all channel-specific settings: API keys, URLs, and webhooks. If you have multiple channels, make sure to select the correct one from the list on the left before making any changes.

### Manage the API keys

You can view the public and secret API keys used to authenticate your business, as well as regenerate them if needed—for example if you think they might have been shared when they shouldn't have been.

1.  In the _API keys_ section, you can view your current public and secret key.
2.  Review the warning, then enter your password.
3.  Select _Update secret key_ to confirm.

<TipBox variant="note" >

If you think the security of one of your keys may have been compromised, you can select _Regenerate_ next it to replace it with a new one. Note that this will require updating your integration with the new key.

</TipBox >

### Update the URL

If you've made any changes to your success URL or failure URL, you'll need to update your settings accordingly.

<img src="/docs/TheHub/UpdateYourHubSettings/2-channel-settings.png"  />

1.  In the _URLs_ section, edit your URLs as required.
2.  Select _Save changes_ to confirm. Your changes are applied instantly.

### Create a new channel

If you are an admin owner, you can create a new channel as described below.

<img src="/docs/TheHub/UpdateYourHubSettings/3-channel-settings2.png"  />

1.  Select _New channel_ in the top left.
2.  Enter your channel details.
3.  Select _Save channel_ to confirm.
4.  Review the terms and conditions.
5.  If everything looks okay, tick _I agree with all the above_ then select _Confirm agreement_. Your channel is created and added to the list of channels on the left.

### Manage webhooks

All administrators can add, edit, or delete webhooks. For more information, see [Manage webhooks in the Hub](/the-hub/manage-webhooks).

## Manage the business settings

### Manage the users

The _User management_ section allows administrators to view and manage users. You can edit an existing user's permissions in order to change their role or add/remove access to a specific business. Note that permissions are always granted by business, rather than at the account level.

<img maxWidth={543} src="/docs/TheHub/UpdateYourHubSettings/4-user-management.png"  />

### Add a new user

To add a new user, select _New user_, found in the _User management_ section of _Settings_ (see screenshot above).

Once created, their profile is added to the user list and they will receive an email inviting them to log in to the Hub.

### Update the bank account details

If you are an admin owner, you can update your bank account details—such as the IBAN, sort code, bank address, or account number.

1.  Go to _Settings > Payouts._
2.  Select a bank account. The bank account details are displayed in a new window.

<img maxWidth={543} src="/docs/TheHub/UpdateYourHubSettings/5-add-user.png"  />

3. Select _Edit_.  
4. Make your desired changes.   
5. Select _Save changes_ to confirm.
