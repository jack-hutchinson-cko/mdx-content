When an event occurs, we send you a webhook notification to inform you of the situation. You'll find out what happened and the type of issue at hand, enabling you to take action and keep your business running smoothly.

Webhooks provide a definitive confirmation of a status update and are used for a variety of purposes, such as fulfilling orders, sending automated status updates to customers, or even integrating with third-party application services.

You can manage webhooks in the channel settings section of the Hub or by [using our API](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks/webhook-management).

Use this page to learn how to manage webhooks in the Hub. Note that only administrators will be able to do this.
