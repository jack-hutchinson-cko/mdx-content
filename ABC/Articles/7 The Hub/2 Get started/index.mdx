## Log in

<img src="/docs/TheHub/GetStarted/1-logIn.png"  />

There are two environments for you to choose from when logging in to the Hub:

*   the live environment
*   the sandbox environment

The <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com/login" >live</ExternalLink> environment enables you to monitor your business's performance in real time.

The <ExternalLink href="https://sandbox.checkout.com/login" >sandbox</ExternalLink> environment allows you to safely try out the Hub's features. For example, you can create payments using our [test cards](/testing/test-card-numbers) without running the risk of actually charging a customer. 

<TipBox variant="info">

If you are logging in for the first time, you will need to set a password for your account. Your login details will be the same for both the live and sandbox environments.

</TipBox>

## Navigate the Hub

Getting around the Hub is really easy—just select an icon in the sidebar to access the corresponding screen.

<TipBox variant="tip">

If your display is on the smaller side, select _Collapse sidebar_ at the bottom of the left menu to give the content more space. You can always revert back to the standard view by selecting the icon again.

</TipBox>

### Business / channel selector

If you have multiple business channels, the Hub will combine and display data for all of them by default. To view data related to a specific business channel, select the drop-down menu in the top left and choose a business channel.

### Date selector

By default, the Hub displays today’s data in the _Dashboard_, _Payments_, and _Customers_ screens.

If you want to view older data, select _Date filter_ in the top right then select a date or date range. To select a date range, select the start date then the end date. Your selected date range will be highlighted in green.

<img maxWidth={360} src="/docs/TheHub/GetStarted/3-date-selector.png"  />

The Hub will temporarily save this date filter for you, so you can switch from one screen to another without having to set it again. It will automatically set the default back to today’s date next time you log in.

## About the dashboard

The dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in to the Hub. It allows you to check how your business is doing at a glance. You can review your key performance indicators, refunds, disputes, payment methods and currencies.

<TipBox variant="info" title="Dashboard display currency and timezone">

You can change the dashboard display currency in the _Settings_ screen. Note that this won’t affect the processing and payouts currency displayed in any other areas of the Hub. You can also change the display timezone, though reports downloaded within the _Reports_ section will always use a UTC timestamp.
