The Hub's Payments screen enables you to view your full payment history, as well as take actions such as capturing or refunding a payment.

## Overview

The Payments screen is probably the most important screen in the Hub. It shows you the full payment activity for your business for the selected period.

Each line corresponds to a payment action, which you can think of as a status that your payment has been through at some point. For example, if a payment is authorized with autocapture, you will see two lines with an almost identical timestamp: one will be an `AUTH` action, the other will be a `CAPTURE`.

To view more information about a payment and the actions that have been taken against it, select a row. A pane will open on the right side of your screen.

The full list of actions related to that specific payment is displayed at the top, with the most recent one first. You can also view customer details, action details, and finally payment details. It's also from here that you can blacklist, refund, void, or capture—but more on that later.

### Payouts

If payouts are enabled on your account, these will also be visible in your _Payments_ screen. Just like with payments, you can select them to view more details.

Payouts can only have two possible actions: `PAID` and `DECLINED`.

Payouts to card are only available for merchants based in the EEA region and can be enabled for Mastercard and Visa. If you'd like to start using this feature, please contact your Customer Success manager to assess your eligibility.

## Filter results

You can use filters to narrow down the list of payment actions displayed in your _Payments_ screen.

### Search

To perform a search, start typing the first few letters or numbers of what you're looking for. The results displayed in the _Payments_ screen are updated as you type.

### Advanced search

By default, the search looks for keywords beginning with what you've typed and checks multiple fields. However, you can also search for results containing, ending with, or exactly matching your keyword, as well as restrict which fields are taken into account. Select _Filters_ at the top of the screen to display all of the search options.

### Filtering by action or email address

You can quickly filter all payment actions related to an email address by hovering next to it until a filter icon appears and selecting it. This also works for payment actions of a specific type, such as captures.

## Create a payment

If your business accepts virtual terminal / MOTO (mail order telephone order) payments, you can create a new payment right in the Hub.

1.  In the _Payments_ screen, select _Create payment_ in the top right.
2.  If you have multiple businesses, select the appropriate one from the drop-down.
3.  Select a channel.
4.  Enter the customer's email address.
5.  Add the payment and card details.
6.  Optionally, delay the capture or add extra information about the payment by selecting _More options_ and filling in the desired fields.
7.  Select _Create payment_ to confirm. The new payment is added to the _Payments_ screen.

## Capture, void, or refund a payment

Once a payment has been authorized, you can decide whether to capture it, void it, or refund it.

1.  In the _Payments_ screen, select a payment. The payment details pane opens on the right.
2.  Select an action.
3.  If you want to perform a partial capture or refund, enter the amount of your choice.
4.  Select the confirmation button.
5.  Refresh the _Payments_ screen. You will see your action in the list.

## Blacklist future payments

You can blacklist payments based on: an email address, a phone number, a card number, or an IP address. In the payment details pane, select _Blacklist_ in the top right, toggle the relevant attributes then select _Blacklist_ to save.
