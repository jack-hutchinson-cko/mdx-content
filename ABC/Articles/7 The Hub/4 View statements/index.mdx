Statements are an easy way to view the processed amount, refunds, chargebacks, processing fees, rolling reserve moments, and general adjustments for a given period.

## About statements

Unlike [reports](/the-hub/generate-reports), statements are automatically created based on your payout frequencies. The _Statements_ screen allows you to download all previously created statements.

<TipBox variant="info">

If you're an administrator, you can view your current payout frequencies in the _Settings_ screen, under _Payouts_. To make any changes to your payouts, please contact your Customer Success manager.
