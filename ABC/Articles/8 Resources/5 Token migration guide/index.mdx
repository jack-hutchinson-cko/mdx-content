## How it works

### Step 1: You request a migration

To start the process off, you need to request a token migration from your current service provider. There'll be a lot of sensitive data to transfer, so put us in touch with them and we can securely arrange the data move for you.

### Step 2: We retrieve your data

We will provide your current service provider with the minimum required fields for a successful migration. A secure SFTP channel will then be created, between us and your service provider, and either:
_a._ we will grant access for the service provider to transfer the data,
or _b._ the service provider will grant us access to the file
In both scenarios, your service provider will use the Checkout.com public key to encrypt
the files.

You can download our public key from the following URL:

</TipBox>

### Step 3: We import your data

Once we have the file, our team will decrypt it and import it into your merchant account. Our integration team will then forward the necessary files to you, and provide instructions on how to understand and use them.

*   Checkout.com source ID (reusable card token)
*   Checkout.com customer ID
*   PSP card token (as a mapping reference)
*   Card last 4 digits
