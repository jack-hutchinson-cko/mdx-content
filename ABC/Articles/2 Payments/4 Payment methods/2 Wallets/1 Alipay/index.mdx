## Overview

Alipay payments follow a two-step process:

1.  [Request an Alipay payment](/payments/payment-methods/wallets/alipay#Request_a_payment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](/payments/payment-methods/wallets/alipay#Redirect_the_customer)

## Request a payment

### Endpoints

For the full API specification, see the <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Payments/paths/~1payments/post)" >API reference</ExternalLink>.

### Request example

```json
    {
      "source": {
        "type": "alipay"
      },
     "amount": 2000,
     "currency": "USD"
    }
```

<TipBox variant="info">

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, then we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

</TipBox>

### Response example

If a payment `id` is returned, then your request was successful.

```json
    {
      "id": "pay_wu2hdjkzookuji3i2xai2ienlm",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_j4o4tigv4vaebednks3gafrwk4"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/api2/payments/pay_wu2hdjkzookuji3i2xai2ienlm"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/108674"
        }
      }
    }
```

### Redirect the customer

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` linkâ€™s href in the response. The redirect transfers the customer to their bank's website where they are required to enter their authorization details; if successful, the payment can be approved.

Once completed, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of an Alipay payment is communicated only through webhooks. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

## Refund a payment

Alipay supports both partial and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com/v2" >Hub</ExternalLink> or using the [refund API](/payments/manage-payments/refund-a-payment).

---

## Cancel a payment

If the customer cancels or fails to complete the transaction at any point after the payment is created, it will automatically be voided, and we'll send you a `payment_voided` webhook.

---

## Testing Alipay

<TipBox variant="note">

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >create a test account</ExternalLink>, and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate Alipay payments in the sandbox environment.

</TipBox>

1.  Create an Alipay transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to Alipay's website.
2.  Select the button on the right and log in with the following details:
*   **Username**: `alipaytest20091@gmail.com`
*   **Password**: `111111`
3.  Solve the captcha and then select the blue button at the bottom of the form to continue.
4.  Enter `111111` into the box and then select the blue button to complete the payment. You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.
