title: Pay with a pre-decrypted Google Pay token
---

We also support the ability to make payments using Google Pay tokens that you have decrypted. To make use of this feature, use the `network_token` source type and specify the `token_type` as `googlepay`. This source type allows you to provide the details about the token, as well as the cryptogram and ECI value obtained from the Google Pay token.

Use the details below to set up your request.

## Request example

```json

        "token_type": "googlepay",
        "expiry_month": "10",

        "eci": "06",

      "amount": 1000,
      "currency": "USD",
    }
```

## Response

If the `approved` field is `true`, your authorization was successful. If your authorization was not successful, it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.

<TipBox variant="info">

A successful response will include a `payment_account_reference` value, which is a unique reference to the underlying card for network tokens. If the card scheme provided us with an `eci` value, it will be included in the response. The value indicates the security level that the card scheme decided to request the payment with.
