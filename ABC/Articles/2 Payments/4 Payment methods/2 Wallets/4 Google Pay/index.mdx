## Overview

To start processing Google Pay payments, you must first integrate directly with Google. Once integration is complete, you can add the _Google Pay_ button to your checkout page and start requesting your customers' encrypted payment information.

Google Pay integration and payments can be simplified into a three-step method:

1.  [Integrate with Google Pay](/payments/payment-methods/wallets/google-pay#Step_1:_Integrate_with_Google_Pay)
2.  [Tokenize the Google Pay payment data](/payments/payment-methods/wallets/google-pay#Step_2:_Tokenize_the_Google_Pay_payment_data)
3.  [Request the payment](/payments/payment-methods/wallets/google-pay#Step_3:_Request_a_payment_using_Google_Pay)

<TipBox variant="note" title="There is no liability shift!">

Unlike with some other wallets, payments made via Google Pay do **not** benefit from any liability shift. You will be subject to the same liability rules and chargeback policies as with regular credit and debit card payments, as described <ExternalLink href="https://support.google.com/pay/merchants/answer/6288992?hl=en-GB" >here</ExternalLink>. In order to minimize the risk of fraud and chargebacks, you may want to restrict the type of payment cards you accept. For more information, see <ExternalLink href="https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/reference/object" >this section</ExternalLink> of the Google Pay API documentation.

## Step 1: Integrate with Google Pay

<TipBox variant="note">

Before going live, you are required to register with <ExternalLink href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/googlepayAPIenable/" >Google Pay</ExternalLink> and select Checkout.com as your payment processor. You will also need to <ExternalLink href="https://payments.developers.google.com/signup" >whitelist your domain here</ExternalLink>. Note that you must be logged in as a Google Developer to do this. If not, you will be redirected to Google Pay's support page.

</TipBox>

<TipBox>

For information on integrating with Google Pay, first, refer to the <ExternalLink href="https://developers.google.com/pay/api/overview" >Google Pay API guide</ExternalLink>.

</TipBox>

When you submit a payment data request to the Google API, be sure to include the following parameters:

- `'gateway': 'checkoutltd'`
- `'gatewayMerchantId': '<your public key>'`

### Examples

  <tab title="Google Pay API request (web)" active>

```json withBorder={false}
  'allowedPaymentMethods': ['CARD','TOKENIZED_CARD'],
'paymentMethodTokenizationParameters': {
   'tokenizationType': 'PAYMENT_GATEWAY',
   'parameters': {
     'gateway': 'checkoutltd'
     'gatewayMerchantId': ''
   }
}
```

  </tab>
  <tab title="Google Pay API request (Android)">

```json withBorder={false}
private PaymentDataRequest createPaymentDataRequest() {
  PaymentDataRequest.Builder request =
    PaymentDataRequest.newBuilder()
      .setTransactionInfo(
        TransactionInfo.newBuilder()
          .setTotalPriceStatus(WalletConstants.TOTAL_PRICE_STATUS_FINAL)
            .setTotalPrice("10.00")
            .setCurrencyCode("USD")
            .build())
      .addAllowedPaymentMethod(WalletConstants.PAYMENT_METHOD_CARD)                     .addAllowedPaymentMethod(WalletConstants.PAYMENT_METHOD_TOKENIZED_CARD)
      .setCardRequirements(
        CardRequirements.newBuilder()
          .addAllowedCardNetworks(
            Arrays.asList(
              WalletConstants.CARD_NETWORK_VISA,
              WalletConstants.CARD_NETWORK_MASTERCARD))
          .build());
  
  PaymentMethodTokenizationParameters params =
    PaymentMethodTokenizationParameters.newBuilder()
      .setPaymentMethodTokenizationType(
        WalletConstants.PAYMENT_METHOD_TOKENIZATION_TYPE_PAYMENT_GATEWAY)
      .addParameter("gateway", "checkoutltd")
      .addParameter("gatewayMerchantId", "")
      .build();

  request.setPaymentMethodTokenizationParameters(params);
  return request.build();
}
```

  </tab>
</tabs>


<TipBox variant="info">

You will need to specify which card types and card schemes to support in your payment data request. Checkout.com and Google Pay support the use of both Visa and Mastercard.

</TipBox>

## Step 2: Tokenize the Google Pay payment data

Once you have received the payment data from Google, you then need to call Checkout.comâ€™s endpoint for tokenizing the encrypted payment data; you can find this payment data in the `paymentMethodToken` property of the Google Pay payment data request's response.

To find out more about Google Pay payment requests, read the <ExternalLink href="https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/object-reference" >Google Pay object reference</ExternalLink>.

<TipBox variant="note">

Alternatively, if you want to decrypt the Google Pay token yourself and process a payment, follow our [pay with a pre-decrypted token guide](/payments/payment-methods/wallets/google-pay/pay-with-a-pre-decrypted).

</TipBox>

Use the details below to set up your request.

### Endpoints

You can find the full list, as well as complete request and response examples, in our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com" >API reference</ExternalLink>.

### Request example

```json
    {
      "type": "googlepay",
      "token_data": {
        "protocolVersion": "ECv1",
        "signature": "TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ",
        "signedMessage": "{\"encryptedMessage\": \"ZW5jcnlwdGVkTWVzc2FnZQ==\", \"ephemeralPublicKey\": \"ZXBoZW1lcmFsUHVibGljS2V5\", \"tag\": \"c2lnbmF0dXJl\"}"
      }
    }
```

### Response example

```json
    {
      "type": "googlepay",
      "token": "tok_ubfj2q76miwundwlk72vxt2i7q",
      "expires_on": "2018-10-22T15:44:03Z"
    }
```

## Step 3: Request a payment using Google Pay

Now you have the token, it's time to authorize the payment. Take the token, and use it in the body of a card token [payment request](/payments/accept-payments/request-a-card-payment) from your application or website's backend server.

## Test Google Pay

<TipBox variant="note">

To start testing, you need to <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >create a test account</ExternalLink>. Google may ask to see your implementation in the sandbox environment before giving you a merchant ID for production.

</TipBox>

Google Pay does not allow the configuration of test cards within its online wallet. However, when using Google's test environment, if a real card is selected when making the online purchase, Google Pay provides a test card in the encrypted payment data; ensuring that no actual transaction takes place.
