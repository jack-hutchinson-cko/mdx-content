You can accept SEPA Direct Debit (SDD) payments from customers in countries within the Single Euro Payments Area.

The <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area) initiative aims to facilitate seamless, quick, and cost-effective direct debits across 36 (as of March 2019" >SEPA</ExternalLink> European countries. Banks participating in SEPA are not permitted to charge higher fees for cross-border SEPA Direct Debits than they would for direct debits within their home country.

<TipBox variant="info">

To accept payments by SEPA Direct Debit, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

## Overview

First, you need to collect your customers' euro-denominated bank account details, including their IBAN. The bank account holder is then required to accept a mandate to authorize you to debit their account. Once the mandate is approved, submit the mandate details to Checkout.com and we'll provide you with a source object with which you can request a payment.

*   [Issue the mandate](/payments/payment-methods/direct-debit/sepa-direct-debit#Issue_the_mandate)
*   [Pre-notify the customer](/payments/payment-methods/direct-debit/sepa-direct-debit#Pre-notify_the_customer)
*   [Create an SDD payment source](/payments/payment-methods/direct-debit/sepa-direct-debit#Create_a_new_SDD_payment_source)
*   [Request a payment](/payments/payment-methods/direct-debit/sepa-direct-debit#Request_a_payment)

---

## Issue the mandate

Before any payment can occur, your customer must authorize the payment by accepting the terms of the mandate. By accepting, they are authorizing you to collect the specified amount from their bank account using SEPA Direct Debit.

There are two types of mandates:

*   One-off: allows a single payment to be made against the mandate. It can only be used once.
*   Recurring: allows multiple payments to be made against the mandate. It can be reused.

The mandate is accepted using ‘click’ acceptance. This method requires that the mandate’s terms are set out on the same page as where the customer enters their bank account details. The mandate should make it clear that if the customer submits their bank account details to the merchant, they are implicitly agreeing to the mandate.

Once the mandate is approved, you can submit the customer’s information to us, and we'll return the mandate reference to you. You should then present the mandate reference to your customer as confirmation that the mandate has been created.

<TipBox variant="info">

For details about the mandate and more, please read the <ExternalLink href="https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/what-we-do/sepa-direct-debit/sepa-direct-debit-core-rulebook" >SEPA Direct Debit core rulebook</ExternalLink>.

</TipBox>

---

## Pre-notify the customer

Before debiting a customer's account with SEPA Direct Debits, it is mandatory that the customer is informed of the debit by the merchant in an agreed timeframe before the payment. We recommend you include details of this timeframe in your terms and conditions.

Notifications are sent to enable the customer to make sure they have the necessary funds available in their bank account and also to make them aware of the payment so they recognize it in their statement.

Funds will be removed from the customer’s account one or two days after the transaction is submitted. It is a SEPA requirement that you make sure your customers are aware of this.

<TipBox variant="info">

For additional information about pre-notifications, please read the <ExternalLink href="https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/what-we-do/sepa-direct-debit/sepa-direct-debit-core-rulebook" >SEPA Direct Debit core rulebook</ExternalLink>.

## Create a new SDD payment source

Create a new SEPA payment source that can be used to make one or more payments. Creating a source will automatically create a new mandate as well. You'll receive the mandate `reference` in the response, and you can use this if you ever need to [cancel a mandate](#SEPADirectDebit-cancelmandate).

<TipBox variant="info">

Payment sources are linked to a specific customer and cannot be shared between customers.

    }

<TipBox variant="info">

If the source cannot be found, you will get a `404 - Payment source not found` error.

</TipBox>

## Chargebacks

A customer can dispute an SDD payment with their bank when they believe that they did not authorize the payment. However, owing to the asynchronous nature of SDDs, the reasons for a chargeback go beyond the traditional customer-initiated chargebacks. SDD chargebacks may be caused by the IBAN being incorrect, the customer having insufficient funds, or the customer's bank account being closed. If a chargeback occurs, we will let you know through a `payment_chargeback` webhook notification.

If you and your customer did not agree upon the mandate, then the chargeback cannot be represented. You must handle representing an SDD chargeback directly with the customer.

<TipBox variant="info">

Chargebacks can be initiated by the customer up to 13 months after a payment was first processed.

</TipBox>

---

## Testing SDD

<TipBox variant="note">

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >create a test account</ExternalLink>, and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate SEPA payments in the sandbox environment.

</TipBox>

If you want to test the different use cases for SDD payment results, please use the following test IBANs. These IBANs have a valid checksum and should be supplied when creating a new mandate.
