## Overview

EPS payments follow a two-step process:

1.  [Request a payment](/payments/payment-methods/bank-transfers/eps#Request_a_payment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](/payments/payment-methods/bank-transfers/eps#Redirect_the_customer)

---

## Request a payment

Use the details below to set up your request.

### Endpoints

You can find the full list, as well as complete request and response examples, in our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com" >API reference</ExternalLink>.

<tabs>
<tab title="Live" active>
<LineCodeWrapper type="post">

</LineCodeWrapper>
</tab>
<tab title="Sandbox">
<LineCodeWrapper type="post">

### Request example

```json
    {
      "source": {
        "type": "eps",
        "purpose":"Mens black t-shirt L"
      },
     "amount": 1914,
     "currency": "EUR",
     "success_url": "http://example.com/payments/success",
     "failure_url": "http://example.com/payments/fail",
    }
```

<TipBox variant="info">

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, then we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

</TipBox>

### Response example

If you receive a `202 Success` response containing a `status` field set to `Pending`, then your request was successful.

```json
    {
      "id": "pay_wqvd2nukz5dujnmokm7ljhymwa",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_uvs2lu4b7ncurjx5zdtrixnc4e"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_wqvd2nukz5dujnmokm7ljhymwa"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://ftg-customer-integration.giropay.de/ftgbank/b/bankselection/2329733103475232793;jsessionid=6CA094B861DC4D16D1C48D1988DE4A32.sf-testapp02tom24?op=001"
        }
      }
    }
```

---

## Redirect the customer

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the response. This will send them to an EPS bank selection page where they will select their bank before being transferred to that bank's page to enter their authorization details. If successful, the payment can be approved.

Once they've completed this step, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of an EPS payment is communicated **only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

## Refund a payment

EPS supports both partial and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com/v2" >hub</ExternalLink> or using the [refund API](/payments/manage-payments/refund-a-payment).

---

## Cancel a payment

If the customer fails to complete their payment, we will automatically void the payment and send a `payment_expired` webhook.

If the customer cancels their payment, we will send a `payment_canceled` webhook.
