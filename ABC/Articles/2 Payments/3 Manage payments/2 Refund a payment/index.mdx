title: Refund a payment
account: ABC
description: Return funds to a customer either partially or in full.
---

Use a refund to return a payment to a customer. Refunds can be made in the <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com/v2" >Hub</ExternalLink> or by using this API endpoint.

There are two types of refunds you might need to process:

- **Full refund**. A full refund returns the total amount of the payment to the customer — it can only be performed once.
- **Partial refund**. A partial refund returns a sum less than the captured amount. A payment can be refunded multiple times, but cannot exceed the original payment amount.

<TipBox variant="tip">

Refunds are always processed in the same currency as the captured payment.

</TipBox>
<TipBox variant="note">

You cannot cancel a refund after it has been processed.

</TipBox>

---

## Overview

To process a refund successfully, you must provide the payment ID of the captured payment. You can find the ID:

- In the response of the payment request
- In the webhook notification

The requests are the same for partial and full refunds. Any refunds for less than the original captured amount will be considered partial refunds.

<TipBox variant="info">

</TipBox>

## Refund authorization

If the card scheme requires it, we will automatically trigger a refund authorization on your behalf before processing your refund.

<TipBox variant="info">

Refund authorizations only apply to card payments.

</TipBox>

<TipBox variant="tip">

If a refund authorization is requested, you can find the Retrieval Reference Number (RRN) in [refund webhook notifications](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks) and in the [get payment actions](/payments/manage-payments) call.

</TipBox>

If the refund authorization is declined, you will receive a 422 response, like the one below.

```json
{
   "request_id": "f5feff3f-d2ef-4c82-b4d0-ff443731581f",
   "error_type": "processing_error",
   "error_codes": [
       "refund_authorization_declined"
   ]
}
```

If you want to know the reason for the decline, you can either [subscribe to refund webhook notifications](/reporting-and-insights/webhooks), use our [get payment actions endpoint](/payments/manage-payments/get-payment-actions), or view it in your [Hub](/the-hub/manage-hub-payments) account.

<TipBox variant="tip" title="Testing">

To test a declined refund authorization, request a refund with the `amount` set to `3738`.

</TipBox>

## Troubleshooting

If your refund request was unsuccessful, the checklist below may help you identify the problem:

- Is the refund amount higher than the original payment?
- Has the payment already been refunded?
- Did you send the authorization ID instead of the payment ID?
