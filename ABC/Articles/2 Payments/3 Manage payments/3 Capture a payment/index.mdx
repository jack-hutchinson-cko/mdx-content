title: Capture a payment
account: ABC
description: Manually capture an authorized payment.
---

Our two-step authorization and capture process enables you to capture payments either automatically or manually.

When a payment is authorized, the funds are held for seven days. By default, payments are automatically captured. If you wish to manually capture, set the capture field to `false` when [requesting a payment](/payments/accept-payments/request-a-card-payment). You can capture an authorized payment either in full or partially. If you don't capture it within seven days, the payment is voided.

<TipBox variant="tip">

You can [void](/payments/manage-payments/void-a-payment) an authorized payment at any time. However, captured payments can only be [refunded](/payments/manage-payments/refund-a-payment).

</TipBox>

## Overview

If a payment is created with `"capture": "false"`, you can either use this endpoint to capture the payment or capture it from the <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com/v2" >Hub</ExternalLink>. Manual capture is not allowed if `capture` is set to `true`.

<TipBox variant="info" title="Partial captures">

Any capture amount less than the original payment will be treated as a partial capture. You can only make one partial capture per payment.
