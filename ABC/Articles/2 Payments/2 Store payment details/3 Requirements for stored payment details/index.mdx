title: Requirements for stored payment details
account: ABC
---

If you store customers' card details (whether in full on your server, or in a tokenized form) to allow cardholder-initiated transactions (CITs) and merchant-initiated transactions (MITs), you need to provide extra information about these payments to satisfy card scheme requirements.

<TipBox variant="note">

We've introduced a new `merchant_initiated` field to our API, which you must set to `true` in all merchant-initiated transactions.

</TipBox>
<TipBox title="Easily transfer recurring payments to Checkout.com">

If you're considering us as your payment service provider but your subscriptions and other recurring payments are currently processed by another acquirer—no problem! You can use the scheme transaction ID from a payment processed by your current acquirer as your `previous_payment_id` to start processing those payments with us, with no need to take the customer's details again.

## Additional attributes for your saved card payment requests

Below is a summary of the attributes you need to add to payment requests that use stored card details. These additional details help fulfill Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements, and give the issuing bank what they need to approve such payments.

See the sections on  [cardholder-initiated transactions](#Cardholder-initiated_transactions) and  [merchant-initiated transactions](#Merchant-initiated_transactions) further down for more detail.

### Cardholder-initiated and merchant-initiated transactions

- If you use our full card API, storing customers' full card details on your server, you need to flag that you are using previously stored card details by including `source.stored: true` in the request.

### Merchant-initiated transactions only

- For both [scheduled](#Scheduled) and [unscheduled](#Unscheduled) MITs, you must include the `merchant_initiated: true` flag to mark the payment as merchant-initiated, and reference either the [original cardholder-initiated payment or the previous payment](#Previous_payment_ID_explained) in the series of transactions using the `previous_payment_id` attribute.

- The initial cardholder-initiated transaction of a scheduled recurring series should **not** be marked as `"Recurring"` (unless it is a Visa card, in which case it **must** be marked as `"Recurring"`) and it should have `merchant_initiated` set to `false`. All subsequent payments in the series should include `payment_type: "Recurring"`, `merchant_initiated: true` and the `previous_payment_id`.

## Cardholder-initiated transactions

In cardholder-initiated transactions (CITs), the cardholder initiates the payment and authorizes the use of their stored card details. For example, a cardholder ordering takeaway food and using a card previously stored with the merchant.

## Merchant-initiated transactions

Merchant-initiated transactions (MITs) are payments you trigger, where the cardholder has previously consented to you carrying out such payments. These may be [scheduled](#Scheduled) (such as recurring payments and installments) or [unscheduled](#Unscheduled) (like account top-ups triggered by balance thresholds and no-show charges).

### Scheduled

These are regular payments using stored card details, like installments or a monthly subscription fee.

### Required attributes for scheduled MITs

<TipBox variant="info" title="Add a card for scheduled MITs">

If you're [adding a Visa card for later scheduled billing without taking a payment](/risk-management/card-verification), you need to include `payment_type: "Recurring"` in your request.

## Previous payment ID explained


Use the attribute `previous_payment_id` to reference either the previous transaction or the opening transaction of the payment series. The `previous_payment_id` is the `payment_id` issued after the authorization of the relevant payment.

Your previous payment ID will contain the prefix `pay_`, for example, `pay_fou2pabzc6we5obvmcwum5ns5e`.

### Using the previous payment ID

Scheduled and unscheduled MITs can begin in two ways: a card verification or a payment. In the example below, you could reference the `previous_payment_id` as either row one or row four.

## FAQs

<Accordion title="What do I do if a subscription flow involves both scheduled and unscheduled payments?">

Card schemes handle scheduled (recurring) and unscheduled (not recurring) payments differently, so it's important that you include the proper identifiers in your payment requests to distinguish between these two types of merchant-initiated transactions (MITs). See above for the attributes required for [scheduled](#Scheduled) and [unscheduled](#Unscheduled) MITs.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="If I save card details after a payment, should I include the previous_payment_id in following payments made with that saved card?">

If _you_ are initiating payments with saved card details—a merchant-initiated transaction (MIT)—then, yes, you must submit the `previous_payment_id` with your payment requests. This links the subsequent MITs with the initial transaction made by the cardholder.

If the _cardholder_ is making further transactions with their saved card—a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT)—then you don't need to include the `previous_payment_id`. But you should include `"source.stored": true` in the request, to flag that the payment is being made with a saved card.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do I need to add the merchant_initiated field for installments?">

For the first customer-initiated transaction in the installment plan, you should add `"merchant_initiated": false` to your request. For all following installments you initiate, you must include `"merchant_initiated": true`. See the [attributes required for scheduled merchant-initiated transactions above](#Scheduled).
