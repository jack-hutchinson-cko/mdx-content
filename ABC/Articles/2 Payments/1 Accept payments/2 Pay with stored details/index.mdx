title: Pay with stored details
account: ABC
description: Process a payment using a previously-obtained source ID.
---

There's no need to request your customers’ card details for every payment. Instead, you can use a stored card's source ID to securely process their subsequent payments without having to re-enter their card number. It's simple, fast, and secure!

---

## How it works

After your customer makes an initial order, we securely store the card information as a payment instrument, each one identified by a unique ID (prefixed with `src_`). This source ID replaces the card number in all future payments, removing the need to re-enter and exchange sensitive payment information.

<TipBox variant="info">

We do not store a card's CVV (the three- or four-digit number on the back of the card) in a payment instrument. If you want to run a [CVV check](/risk-management/cvv-check) on a payment using the source ID, you should include the CVV in your request.

### Request example

```json
{
  "source": {
    "type": "id",
    "id": "src_aj4isch2q2lujekf2o4cenzrpe",
    "cvv": 100
  },
  "amount": 6000,
  "currency": "USD",
  "reference": "ORD-5023-4E89"
}
```

### Response examples

Use the `approved` field to check whether or not the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). If your authorization was not successful, it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.

If you received a `202` response, the payment requires a redirect. For example, if the payment is 3D Secure.

The possible values for the `status` field include `Authorized`, `Captured`, `Card Verified`, `Declined`, and `Pending`. Note that `Pending` only applies to 3D Secure payments and alternative payments.
