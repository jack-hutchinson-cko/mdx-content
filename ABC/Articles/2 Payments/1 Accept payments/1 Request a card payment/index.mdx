title: Request a card payment
account: ABC
description: Request a payment using a token, a network token, or full card details.
---

Once _you've_ successfully set up your integration, you're able to start receiving and tokenizing your customers' card details. After this tokenization process, you're ready to create a payment. To do this, you can use our API and your server-side code.

---

## How it works

<img src="/docs/Payments/Card+token.png"  />

<TipBox variant="tip">

Card tokens (`tok_`) are single use and only have a 15-minute lifespan. Once you've successfully sent your request, you'll receive a response containing a permanent card source ID (`src_`) which can be used in subsequent payment requests.

### Request example

```json
{
  "source": {
    "type": "token",
    "token": "tok_4gzeau5o2uqubbk6fufs3m7p54"
  },
  "amount": 6500,
  "currency": "USD",
  "reference": "ORD-5023-4E89",
  "metadata": {
    "udf1": "TEST123",
    "coupon_code": "NY2018",
    "partner_id": 123989
  }
}
```

### Response example

Use the `approved` field to check whether or not the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). If your authorization was not successful, it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.

If you received a `202` response, the payment requires a redirect. For example, if the payment is 3D Secure.

<TipBox variant="tip">

The following pages can help you understand the response message:

- [CVV codes and descriptions](/resources/codes/cvv-response-codes)
- [AVS codes](/resources/codes/avs-codes)
- [Response codes](/resources/codes/response-codes) (if the authorization was unsuccessful)

</TipBox>

The possible values for the `status` field include `Authorized`, `Captured`, `Card Verified`, `Declined`, and `Pending`. Note that `Pending` only applies to 3D Secure payments and alternative payments.

## Next step

Once you've successfully processed a card payment request, you're able to easily [reuse those card details](/payments/accept-payments/pay-with-stored-details)Â for subsequent payments.
