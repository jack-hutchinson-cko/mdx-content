  }
}
```

```json
"_links": {
  "next": {
    "href": "https://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments?from=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&to=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&limit=1&after=11111111"

## Download a CSV

In addition to the JSON format described above, you can download a CSV report containing the data from the payments endpoint. To do this, follow the steps below.

### How to download the CSV file

In the URL for the payments endpoint, add `/download` after `/payments`. An example of this can be found below:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments/download?from={start-date-time}&to={end-date-time}
```

If you are using Postman or an equivalent application, rather than sending the GET request, use the **Send and Download** functionality for the GET request to download the CSV report.

Using `/download` will return a CSV containing all your payments unlike a standard request, which is paginated.

You can also get a CSV report by amending the Headers section of the request to accept a value of `text/csv`. Note that this will contain the same paginated results as the JSON.

### How to read the CSV file

In your CSV file, a single payment is uniquely identified by an ID in the first column of the table and will be made of multiple rows, each of them reflecting a fee or an amount applied to a different action within the payment lifecycle.

Regardless of the parameters in your request, the payments endpointâ€™s CSV file will have the same overall structure and columns titles which can be split into three sections.

### 1. Payment and card attributes

This section displays all payment and card attributes in accordance with your chosen parameters.

### 2. Actions

This section outlines all the actions â€” authorization, void, capture, refund and chargeback â€” which have been administered to a payment.

### 3. Breakdown

This section provides details of the associated amounts to an action in both the processing and the payout currencies.

## Limit results

Responses from the payments endpoint can be large, depending on the number of payments you process and the parameters you have chosen. By default, each page includes 200 results.

To limit your results, add `limit=` followed by a number of your choice (up to 500) at the end of the URL.

For example:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments?from=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&to=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&limit=100
```

You can only limit results for JSON responses. A CSV will always contain all possible results.
