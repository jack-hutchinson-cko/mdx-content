Learn how to create requests and receive responses from both the payments and statements endpoints of the Reconciliation API, using the Postman application.

---

## Before you start

- Download and install the Postman application. You can find it here: <ExternalLink href="https://www.getpostman.com" >https://www.getpostman.com</ExternalLink>.
- Grab your secret key. You can find it in the <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com/login" >Hub</ExternalLink> under _Settings > Channels._

---

## Payments endpoint

### Step 1: Configure the endpoint

In the GET field, enter the following endpoint:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments
```

### Step 2: Set your parameters

To use this endpoint, you need to specify one of the 3 parameters below:

- date / time in <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) (`from` and `to`" >ISO format</ExternalLink>
- payment ID (`paymentId`)
- reference (`reference`)

In the example below, we'll specify the date / time, i.e., the timeframe during which the payments occurred.

In the _Params_ tab, enter `From` in the _Key_ column. Add the start date of your timeframe in the _Value_ column — this must be in ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`). In the row below, enter `To` in the _Key_ column and the end date of your timeframe in the _Value_ column.

You can also add your parameter directly to your endpoint. For example:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments?from={start-date-time}&to={end-date-time}
```

<TipBox variant="info">

The same logic applies for the other available parameters:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments/{paymentId}
```

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments?reference={reference}
```

</TipBox>

### Step 3: Authenticate your request

After setting your parameters, you need to authenticate your request with your secret key and specify the response format you would like to receive.

In the _Headers_ tab, enter `Authorization` in the _Key_ column. In the _Value_ column, add your secret key. You can find your secret key in the _Settings > Channels_ section of the <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com" >Hub</ExternalLink>. Next, enter `Content-Type` in the _Key_ column and `application/json` in the _Value_ column.

### Step 4: Send your request

### If you want a JSON response...

Select _Send_ to submit your request.

The response will be displayed in the bottom half of your screen.

### If you want a CSV report...

Add `/download` in the URL field after `payments`, like this:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments/download?from={start-date-time}&to={end-date-time}
```

Select the down arrow to the right of the Send button, then select _Send and Download._

/>

Once the download is complete, save the file to your preferred location. You can name it anything you like — just make sure your filename ends in `.csv`.

## Statements endpoint

### Step 1: Configure the endpoint

In the GET field, enter the following endpoint:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/statements?from={start-date}&to={end-date}
```

<TipBox variant="note">

When using the statements endpoint, you **must** include a date for when the Statement ID was created (or the timeframe in which it was created).

</TipBox>

### Step 2: Authenticate your request

In the Headers tab, enter `Authorization` in the _Key_ column. In the _Value_ column, add your secret key. You can find your secret key in the _Settings > Channels_ section of the <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com/login" >Hub</ExternalLink>.

Next, enter `Content-Type` in the _Key_ column and `application/json` in the _Value_ column.

The end result should look something like this:

### Step 3: Send your request

### If you want a JSON response...

Select _Send_ to submit your request.

<img maxWidth={240} src="/docs/Reporting_and_insights/Postman guide/postman-send-1.png"  />

The JSON response will be displayed in the bottom half of your screen.

### If you want a CSV report...

Add `/download` in the URL field after `statements`, like this:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/statements/download?from={start-date-time}&to={end-date-time}
```

Select the down arrow to the right of the _Send_ button, then select _Send and Download_.

<img

  src="/docs/Reporting_and_insights/Postman guide/postman-send-and-download-1.png"
  
/>

Once the download is complete, save the file to your preferred location. You can name it anything you like — just make sure your filename ends in `.csv`.

## Extensions

### Payout breakdown

You can break down the detail even further by using the `payout_breakdown` field. This will provide all totals from each section of the statement.

Set up your request as above, then simply add `&include=payout_breakdown` at the end of the URL.

For example:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/statements?from=2018-09-01&to=2018-09-19&include=payout_breakdown
```

<TipBox variant="success">

You can download a CSV copy by adding `/download` after `statements` in the URL, like this:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/statements/download?from={start-date-time}&to={end-date-time}&include=payout_breakdown
```

</TipBox>

### Statements / statement ID / payments

This extension will allow you to retrieve the list of payments and associated fees included in a given statement, payout or payout currency.

You can filter your request using any of the three parameters defined below.

### Statement ID:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/statements/{StatementId}/payments
```

### Payout ID:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/statements/{StatementId}/payments?payout_id={PayoutId}
```

### Payout currency:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/statements/{StatementId}/payments?payout_currency={PayoutCurrency}
```

<TipBox variant="success">

You can download a CSV copy by adding `/download` after `payments` in the URL, like this:

```json
https://api.checkout.com/reporting/statements/{StatementId}/payments/download
```

</TipBox>
