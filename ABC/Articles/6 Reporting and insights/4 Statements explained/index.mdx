## Value-added tax

Some of our merchants have their businesses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Since January 1, 2018, the UAE is applying a value-added tax (VAT) to all financial services. You can find your VAT invoice on a separate page for each business registered in the UAE.

### VAT invoice header

<img src="/docs/Reporting_and_insights/Statements explained/vat-invoice.png"  />

The header of the VAT Invoice shows some additional information to that explained in [the header](doc:statements-explained#section-statement-report).

Information added to the VAT invoice header:

- **Label 1:** information specific to the relevant Checkout.com subsidiary in the UAE.
- **Label 2 - VAT number:** the merchant’s business VAT Number.

### VAT summary

An overview of the VAT amount to be charged for the invoice period. It's split into VAT amounts per payout; these are then calculated to display the total amount of VAT owed in the local subsidiary’s currency.

Each payout is broken down into two parts:

- **Fees:** the total fees represented in the [fees section](/reporting-and-insights/statements-explained#Statementsexplained-fees) of the statement plus the [payout fee](/reporting-and-insights/statements-explained#Statementsexplained-payoutsummary).
- **VAT:** the VAT charge applied to the total fees. This represents 5 percent of the fees amount.

### Consolidated statement

In a consolidated statement, there is a new section for each payout.

### Consolidated business breakdown

<img src="/docs/Reporting_and_insights/Statements explained/consolidated-business-breakdown.png"  />

This section shows you the payouts (in the respective payout currency) each of your business entities will receive. You'll find it on your statement, after the [payout summary](/reporting-and-insights/statements-explained#Statementsexplained-payoutsummary) and [payout breakdown](/reporting-and-insights/statements-explained#Statementsexplained-payoutbreakdown).

Each business share is broken down into two parts:

- **Amounts carried forward:** the amount carried forward from the previous period.
- **Amounts this period:** the net amount processed during the invoice period.

<TipBox variant="info">

You can request to receive payouts for your individual business entities to the same bank account. This consolidates your businesses' activity into one statement.
