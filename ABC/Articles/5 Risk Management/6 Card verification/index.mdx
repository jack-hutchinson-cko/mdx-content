Card verification allows you to accept and verify a cardholder's payment information without actually billing the customer for a charge. This type of authorization request is particularly useful if you're offering a trial period for a product or service.

For example, you may choose to collect credit card information during an initial registration process but offer a 30-day trial period before charging the customer's credit card. The cardholder's details are saved to their account, allowing you to charge the card when necessary.

## Verify a card

### The request

To verify a card, simply set up a payment request using one of the following endpoints, with the `amount` field omitted or set to `0`.

*   [Request a card payment](/payments/accept-payments/request-a-card-payment)
*   [Payment with full card details](/integrate/full-card-details-api)

<TipBox variant="warning">

Some issuing banks do not support card verification and reject the charge request even if all card details are accurate. If the issuing bank refuses the card verification request, a follow-up request will be sent automatically with a $1 total amount (or the equivalent in the submitted processing currency).

</TipBox>

### Request example

```json
    {
      "source": {
        "type": "token",
        "token": "tok_yo2zfqgdnn4u7gswjbjmqt5mza"
      },
      "currency": "USD"
    }
```

### The response

If the `approved` field is `true` and the `status` field has a value of `Card Verified`, the verification was successful. If unsuccessful, the card may be invalid/expired or the account may have an insufficient available balance.

If you received a `202` response, a redirect is required (e.g., because 3D Secure authentication is required).

<TipBox variant="info" title="Verifying a card for payouts">

If you're verifying a card before paying out to it, you should pay particular attention to the `source.payouts` and `source.fast_funds` fields. [See below for details](#Cardverification-verificationforpayouts).

### Verifying a card for payouts

If you're verifying a card before paying out to it, you should pay particular attention to the `source.payouts` and `source.fast_funds` fields in the card verification response.

If the card is **eligible for payouts**, you'll see `"payouts": true` in the `source` object.

And if the card is **enabled for Fast Funds** (meaning the card allows funds to be deposited in the recipient's account within 30 minutes, rather than within 48 hours), you'll see the `fast_funds` field in the `source` object with one of the following values, which define the geographic scope as detailed in the table below.

*   `d`: domestic transactions only
*   `c`: cross-border transactions only
*   `dc`: domestic and cross-border transactions
*   `u`: unsupported

<TipBox variant="info">

If you want to test seeing payout eligibility and Fast Funds enablement in a response, use this test card in your card verification request: `4242424242424242`.

<TipBox variant="note">

Fast Funds is widespread in the European Economic Area (EEA), but cannot be guaranteed.

## One dollar authorization

If a standard card verification request (zero dollar authorization) is not successful, our payment gateway will automatically submit a new request to verify the card details. This follow-up request will automatically set the value to $1 (or the equivalent amount in the processing currency).

Once authorized, this payment will be automatically voided and the amount will be returned to the customer.

<TipBox variant="info">

Note that the value field is now returned as `100` in the response example, which, in this case, is equivalent to $1.
