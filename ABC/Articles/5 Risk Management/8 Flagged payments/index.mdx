title: Flagged payments
account: ABC
description: Identify and follow up on suspicious transactions.
---

The flag status is used to alert you to any suspicious transactions on your account. Not every flagged payment is fraudulent, but flags indicate that a payment is worth investigating.

The risk settings configured for your business control when a flagged payment is triggered. When a payment is flagged, you must either [capture](/payments/manage-payments/capture-a-payment) or [void](/payments/manage-payments/void-a-payment) it manually. If you take no action, the payment expires automatically after seven days, and the funds return to the customer.

## Flagged payments in the API

When using our API, a flagged payment is indicated in the response with `"flagged": true`. The field looks like this:

```json
    "risk": {
      "flagged": true
    }
```

## Flagged payments in the Hub

In the Hub's Payments screen, flagged payments are identified by an orange status message. Flagged payments will not be captured automatically â€” even with auto-capture enabled.
