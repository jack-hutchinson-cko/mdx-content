This guide will show you how to integrate 3D Secure 2 (3DS2) into your payment flows.

<TipBox variant="info">

We currently support version 2.1.0 of the 3DS protocol.

</TipBox>

---

## Request a 3DS2 payment with a card token

Simply submit a payment request with `"3ds.enabled": true`, and then we'll redirect your customer to a Checkout.com page to gather all the 3DS2-relevant data and add the required fields to your request—meaning no extra work for you.

---

### Step 1: Collect a card token

First, the customer needs to exchange their card details for a card token – tokenization. You can create a card token with one of our [integration options](/integrate).

### Step 2: Create a card token payment request

Once you've got a card token, you can request a payment using [the request a card payment endpoint](/payments/accept-payments/request-a-card-payment).

The only difference between a standard card token payment and a 3DS one is the `3ds` object. Set the `enabled` field to `true` to request a 3DS2 payment.

You can see an example of a request below:

<TipBox variant="info" title="Downgrade a 3DS transaction">

If you want to automatically attempt a transaction as non-3DS, use the [`attempt_n3d`](#id-3DSecure2APIintegration-downgrade) field.

</TipBox>

```json
    {
      "source": {
        "type": "token",
        "token":"tok_f6z4mnoububudpqnvhwa5ff27u"
      },
      "amount": 2000,
      "currency": "USD",
      "3ds": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
```

<TipBox variant="info" title="3DS test cards">

If you want to test 3DS authentication flows and transaction statuses in the sandbox environment, [use our test cards](/testing/3d-secure-testing).

</TipBox>

### Step 3: Redirect your customer

If the card is enrolled for 3DS2 you'll receive a `202 - Accepted` response containing a `redirect` link to which you should redirect your customer.

<TipBox variant="info" title="3DS1 fallback">

If the customer's card is not enrolled for 3DS2, we will automatically attempt to authenticate the payment with 3DS1.

</TipBox>

```json
    {
      "id": "pay_hehfmlkpykeupofyxf7nbr6yyy",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_u4a4zosnrw7ehhzr7jipbkdzo4"
      },
      "3ds": {
        "downgraded": false,
        "enrolled": "Y"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_hehfmlkpykeupofyxf7nbr6yyy"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/api2/v2/3ds/acs/sid_feixbit6us3utfedjulm6egnsu"
        }
      }
    }
```

The customer may then be prompted to verify their identity — generally with a password.

<TipBox variant="info" title="Redirection URLs">

You can configure redirection success and redirection failure URLs in your Hub dashboard or in the payment request itself by setting the `success_url` and `failure_url` fields.

</TipBox>

### Step 4: Verify the payment with the session ID

When the customer is redirected back to your site, a `cko-session-id` querystring parameter is provided at the end of the success URL. It will look something like this:

`http://example.com/success?cko-session-id=sid_ubfj2q76miwundwlk72vxt2i7q`

Once you've got the `cko-session-id`, you can use our [get payment details endpoint](/payments/manage-payments/get-payment-details) to determine whether the payment was authenticated and authorized.

<TipBox variant="note">

The `cko-session-id` expires 15 minutes after being created.

</TipBox>

### Response example

Check the `3ds.authentication_response` field to see the result of the 3DS authentication. It will be one of the following values:

*   `Y` – Cardholder was successfully authenticated.
*   `A` – Authentication was attempted but could not be completed.
*   `N` – Authentication failed.
*   `U` – Authentication could not be completed owing to technical or other problems.

Check the `approved` field to see whether or not the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). If the authorization was unsuccessful, the card might be invalid/expired, or have an insufficient balance.

<TipBox variant="info">

The response includes an `actions` object, which only applies to 3D Secure payments. It gives you a summary of all the actions performed for that payment. This allows you to obtain the response code of the authorization if it was declined.

## Non-3DS authorization request flows

### Successful non-3DS authorization request flow

<img src="/docs/Risk management/Non-3DS-authorization.png" alt="Non-3DS authorization"  />

If you make a payment request without the `3ds` object, or with `"3ds.enabled": false`, and the issuer does not require 3DS authorization for the transaction, the payment will complete successfully.

### Non-3DS authorization request flow with soft decline

<img src="/docs/Risk management/Non-3DS-authorization-with-soft-decline.png" alt="Non-3DS authorization with soft decline"  />

If, however, you make a payment request without the `3ds` object, or with `"3ds.enabled": false`, and the issuer **does** require 3DS2 authorization for the transaction, you will receive a soft decline response (response code 20154). You will then need to resubmit the payment as a 3DS2 payment.

## Handling non-enrolled cards

To handle cases where the customer's card is not enrolled for any version of 3DS, you can set the `attempt_n3d` field to `true` (see the example request below) to downgrade the transaction to non-3DS. This means that if the customer's bank does not support 3DS, we will automatically attempt to process the payment without 3DS authentication instead.

<TipBox variant="note">

If you downgrade the payment to non-3DS, the liability shift advantage of 3DS2 will not apply, meaning you will not be protected against potentially fraudulent payments or chargebacks.
