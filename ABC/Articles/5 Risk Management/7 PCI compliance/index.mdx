## What is PCI and why it is important?

Any organization involved with the processing, transmission, or storage of card data must comply with the <ExternalLink href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards" >Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards</ExternalLink> (PCI DSS).

Checkout Technology Ltd, a company within the Checkout.com group, is certified for PCI DSS as a **Level 1 Service Provider**, which is the highest standard set by the payment card industry to ensure that credit card data is processed, stored or transmitted in a secure environment.

## Who is responsible for PCI DSS compliance?

PCI compliance is a shared responsibility between your business and Checkout.com. So, when accepting payments, it is essential that you do so in a PCI-compliant manner. The complexity of this depends on your integration methods, but the simplest way is never to see or access your customers' card data. Here are our tips:

*   Use one of our integration methods that allows you to accept payments without ever handling card data: [Frames](/integrate/frames) and [Hosted Payments Page](/integrate/hosted-payments-page).

*   Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all payment pages, so that they use HTTPS.

*   Review and validate your PCI compliance once a year. Most can do this with a <ExternalLink href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=saqs#results" >Self-Assessment Questionnaire</ExternalLink> (SAQ), which is provided by the <ExternalLink href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/" >PCI Security Standards Council</ExternalLink>.

## What are the requirements?

There are four levels of PCI compliance that merchants are organized under, based upon their card transaction count over a 12-month period. The PCI level in combination with the integration method will determine the compliance requirements for each merchant. If you have any question concerning your PCI obligations please feel free to send an email to <ExternalLink href="mailto:pci.operations@checkout.com">pci.operations@checkout.com</ExternalLink>..
