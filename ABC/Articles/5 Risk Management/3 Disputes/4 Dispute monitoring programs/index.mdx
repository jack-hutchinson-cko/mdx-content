title: Dispute monitoring programs

Card schemes (like Visa and Mastercard) monitor your dispute activity month by month, comparing it to your sales. If the number of disputes (also known as chargebacks) you receive exceeds the levels deemed acceptable by the scheme, you may be placed on their monitoring program.

Once you’re on a program, the scheme can charge you monthly fines and additional fees, until you reduce the dispute activity back down to acceptable levels.

We will let you know if you’re at risk of being placed, or have been placed, on a program, and work with you to reduce your disputes.

<TipBox>

To learn how to handle and help reduce chargebacks, read our guide on [responding to disputes.](/risk-management/disputes/responding-to-disputes)

</TipBox>

If you fail to comply within a specified time period (this depends on the scheme), the scheme can refuse to continue processing your payments. This is rare, but it's best to take immediate action if you're enrolled on a program.


Learn about [Visa’s](/risk-management/disputes/dispute-monitoring-programs#Disputemonitoringprograms-visa) and [Mastercard’s](/risk-management/disputes/dispute-monitoring-programs#Disputemonitoringprograms-mastercard) dispute monitoring programmes below.

## Visa's dispute monitoring program

The Visa Dispute Monitoring Program (VDMP) has two levels: Standard or Excessive (or High-Risk). The total number of disputes you had in a month and your dispute-to-sales ratio for that month decide which level you’ll be placed on. We will notify you if you're placed on the program.

If you're at risk of exceeding the program's thresholds, you won't be placed on the program immediately. Instead, we’ll send you an Early Warning notification and you’ll be given time to reduce your dispute levels to avoid being placed on the program.

<TipBox variant='note'>

You may be placed directly on the Standard or Excessive timelime if you're already exceeding the Early Warning thresholds.

### VDMP thresholds, timelines, and fines

<tabs>
<tab title='Early warning'>

Early Warning notifications are given monthly, and only if you exceeded the thresholds detailed below in the previous calendar month.

There are no fines or additional fees associated with being provided with an early warning, but we will work with you to reduce your dispute activity.

### Thresholds

</tab>
<tab title='Standard'>

You will be placed on the Standard program level of the VDMP if you meet or exceed 100 chargebacks and a 0.90% dispute-to-sales count ratio in the previous calendar month. We will notify you if this happens.

For the first four months, you will be in a workout period: you won’t be charged any fines and you’ll have the opportunity to reduce your dispute activity.

If you fail to act by month five, you’ll be charged fines and additional fees in line with the timeline below.

You will be placed on the Excessive timeline if:

- Your business has a high-risk merchant category code (MCC), and you have at least 100 disputes and a 0.90% dispute-to-sales ratio in the previous calendar month, **or**
- Your business has a non-high-risk MCC, and you have at least 1,000 chargebacks and a 1.80% dispute-to-sales ratio, **or**
- You were moved from the Standard to the Excessive timeline because Visa Europe determined that you cause undue harm to the goodwill of the Visa payment system.

Unlike the Standard timeline, you will start being charged for each dispute immediately, on top of existing dispute fees. If you fail to reduce your disputes by month seven, Visa will also charge you a review fee.

### How does Visa calculate the dispute ratio?

Visa calculates the dispute-to-sales ratio as follows: the number of disputes you received during the month divided by the number of sales you processed during that same month, multiplied by one hundred.

For example, if you had 175 disputes in January, and had 5,500 sales in January, you would have a dispute-to-sales ratio of 3.18% (175 / 5500 x 100).

This would place you on the Standard level of the VDMP (if you were in a non-high-risk merchant category).

### How to exit the VDMP

Visa will remove you from the program if your dispute activity falls below the Standard thresholds for three consecutive months.

## Mastercard's dispute monitoring program

Mastercard’s Acquirer Chargeback Monitoring Program (ACMP) has two levels: Excessive Chargeback Merchant (ECM) or High Excessive Chargeback Merchant (HECM). The total number of chargebacks you had in a month and your chargeback-to-sales ratio for that month decide which level you’ll be placed on. We will notify you if you're placed on the program.

### How does Mastercard calculate the chargeback rate?

Mastercard measures your chargeback rate in ‘basis points’, using the number to define which level of the program you fall into.

These basis points are calculated as follows: the number of chargebacks issued during the month in question, divided by the number of Mastercard transactions you processed in the previous month, multiplied by 10,000.

For example, if you had 185 chargebacks in February and processed 7,500 payments in January, you would have a chargeback rate of 247 basis points (185 / 7500 x 10,000 = 246.66, rounded up to 247). This would place you on the Excessive Chargeback Merchant (ECM) level of the program.

### How to exit the ACMP

Mastercard will remove you from the program if your dispute activity falls below the ECM thresholds for three consecutive months.
