Understand the requirements to integrate with our Frames product by walking through a working code sample. We’ll take you through set up to tokenization of the card details, so you are ready to request a payment.

This integration builder assumes you have already created an account and have access to your API keys. If you don’t, <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >create your Hub account</ExternalLink> and go to _Settings > Channels_.

<TipBox variant="warning">

Use your public key on the client side. You should **never** include your secret key on the client side for security reasons. Only use the secret key on the server side.
