We have created a React wrapper that contains functions and components to get you up and running with our Frames product. We’ll walk you through how to install the package and then import them into your React project.

<IBuilderDescriptionCard title="Install the Frames package">

To access everything in our React wrapper, install the `frames-react` package into your codebase. We’re using <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/frames-react" >npm</ExternalLink> as our package manager in this example.

`npm install frames-react`

<IBuilderDescriptionCard title="Import the React components" tab="react/src/Form.jsx" lines={[1, 1]}>

Frames is a collection of iframes that we host. When a customer enters payment details into these iframes, we handle this sensitive information and take the responsibility away from you. 

Our React wrapper contains pre-built React components: `Frames`, `CardNumber`, `ExpiryDate` and `Cvv`. `CardNumber`, `ExpiryDate` and `Cvv` are components for the iframes that handle their named data. Imagine the Frames component as a container that wraps around each of these iframes, much like a form is used to describe a collection of input fields.

At the top of the file that hosts the payment form, import these four components from the `frames-react` package.
