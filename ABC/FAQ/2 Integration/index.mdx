<FAQItem title="How do I create a sandbox account?" popularity={20}>

You can create a sandbox account by clicking <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >here</ExternalLink>.

With your sandbox account you can test card payments straight away. If you want to test alternative payment methods, or test payments that use raw card details (assuming you have SAQ-D PCI compliance), please contact our Integration team at <ExternalLink href="https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&tf=1&to=integration@checkout.com" >integration@checkout.com</ExternalLink>.

</FAQItem>

<FAQItem title="I've created a test account. How do I start integrating to my website, and go live?" popularity={44}>

First, you'll want to select your preferred [integration method](/integrate), decide on the [payment methods](/payments/payment-methods) you want to support, and pick any other APIs or capabilities you think you'll find useful.

By default, you can test all your card payment flows. However, if you require any alternative payment methods (e.g., PayPal, Sofort, iDEAL) you can contact our Integration team at <ExternalLink href="mailto:integration@checkout.com">integration@checkout.com</ExternalLink> to enable them on your test account.

Once you've [run some initial tests](/testing) to make sure everything's running smoothly, you can then apply for a live account to start processing payments with us. Please contact our Sales team at <ExternalLink href="mailto:sales@checkout.com">sales@checkout.com</ExternalLink>. We'll need you to complete an online application form, which will then be reviewed by our in-house Onboarding team.

We may ask you to provide further documentation, including corporate structure documentation, legal entity details, bank account information, and principal owners.

Once approved, you’ll execute a contract and we'll provide you with your production credentials.

We then recommend that you perform a test transaction, or run a pilot in production, before processing real customer transactions. This gives you the opportunity to ensure that everything is set up correctly and will work as expected.

After that, you're ready to start accepting live payments from your customers!

<FAQItem title="Which integration method is right for me?" popularity={23}>

**Payment Links** are our simplest method for accepting payments, through any device or channel. Send a payment link to your customer via their preferred channel (email, live chat, text message...) and they'll be taken to a Checkout.com-hosted payment page to complete their purchase.

**Hosted Payments Pages** allow you to accept payments through a Checkout.com-hosted page. The customer enters their payment details on the page, and in the background we generate a token and complete the payment request.

**Frames** is a highly customizable payment form which allows your customers to enter their sensitive card information in a safe environment right on your own checkout page. This information will be exchanged with a secure token that you can use to perform payments. By using Frames your platform will never touch the card details.

**SDKs** (software development kits) give you the freedom to build your own custom payment form on your website or mobile app, or use our own pre-built form. We'll take care of the processing side of things, and return the tokenized payment information to you.

**E-commerce platforms** are great if you want to get up and running quickly. Use one of our plugins to start accepting payments through your favourite e-commerce platform.

**Full card details API** may be the option for you if you're looking for total control over the checkout experience. Unlike our other integration methods, the full card details API does not use card tokens. Instead, you process your customers' card details directly. As a result, you must have the correct level of PCI DSS compliance (Self-Assessment Questionnaire D – SAQ D) to use this method.

You can [learn more about each integration method](/integrate) on our documentation site.

<FAQItem title="How do I integrate Apple Pay into my account?" popularity={27}>

Before you can start accepting Apple Pay payments, you'll need a few things:

- Follow <ExternalLink href="https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/implementation/">Apple's documentation</ExternalLink> to integrate the Apple Pay button, and then follow [our documentation](/payments/payment-methods/wallets) to learn how to process payments after you complete the Apple Pay flow.

<FAQItem title="I'm getting an error saying server_api_not_allowed in my sandbox account. What does this mean?
" popularity={18}>

</FAQItem>

<FAQItem title="I'm getting an error saying 'Checkout Server Api is not allowed'. What does this mean?" popularity={17}>

If your website is built on Shopify or Salesforce Cloud Commerce, or you use Spreedly, please contact our <ExternalLink href="mailto:support@checkout.com">Support team</ExternalLink>.

If you are building a custom integration on your website and collecting the card information in your own payment form to send payment requests to Checkout.com, you will notice this error.

Making requests with raw card details is risky, and we reject it by default. You can still send payment requests with full card details, but this requires you to have the correct level of PCI DSS compliance (Self-Assessment Questionnaire D – SAQ D). If you have this level of certification, please tell your customer success manager and we'll enable this flow for you.

If you don't have the right level of PCI compliance for your platform, you can use [Frames](/integrate/frames), [Hosted Payment Pages](/integrate/hosted-payments-page), or another of our [integration methods](/integrate) to collect the sensitive card data, and then [perform payments](/payments/accept-payments/request-a-card-payment) with the secure token these integrations generate.

</FAQItem>

<FAQItem title="I'm getting an error saying 'business_not_onboarded'. What does this mean?" popularity={14}>

This error occurs when an alternative payment method has been configured for your account but the specific credentials you need to create payments for that method have not been set up.

Please contact your customer success manager or implementation engineer to resolve this.

</FAQItem>

<FAQItem title="How do I get a Checkout.com account?" popularity={22}>

Once your integration has been completed and you wish to get a live account, please contact our Sales team at <ExternalLink href="mailto:sales@checkout.com">sales@checkout.com</ExternalLink>..
