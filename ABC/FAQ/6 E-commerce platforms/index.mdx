<FAQItem title="Magento 2: Does the plugin work with other One Step Checkout plugins?" popularity={21}>

Our plugin is built following Magento's standards. So, if the One Step Checkout plugin you use follows the standards as well, they should be compatible. If you’re having an issue, please contact the support team of the plugin you use in the first instance. If you’re still experiencing difficulties, get in touch with our Support team at <ExternalLink href="mailto:support@checkout.com">support@checkout.com</ExternalLink>.

<FAQItem title="Magento 2: I don’t see Apple Pay as a payment option after I enabled it. Why?" popularity={21}>

<FAQItem title="Magento 2: I’ve enabled all alternative payment methods, but I can't see them on the checkout page. Why?" popularity={21}>

If you want to use alternative payment methods, we first need to enable them on your account. Please email our Support team at <ExternalLink href="mailto:support@checkout.com">support@checkout.com</ExternalLink> for this. In addition, some local payment methods only work in certain currencies, so they won't be displayed if you use a different currency in your store. For example, for Sofort, you need to use EUR to see it as a payment option on your checkout page.

</FAQItem>

<FAQItem title="Magento 2: I’ve installed the plugin, but I get this error in the apache logs: “Class Checkout\Library\HttpHandler does not exist”. Why?" popularity={21}>

To ensure your payments work in the live environment, follow the checklist below when moving from sandbox to live:

- Update the environment to live/production.
- Update your secret key in the plugin settings.
- Update your public key in the plugin settings.

- If you use wallets, like Apple Pay and Google Pay, make sure you update the IDs and certificates with the live/production details.

<FAQItem title="Magento 2: Why are the Frames fields not showing or not clickable?" popularity={21}>

<FAQItem title="Magento 2: Why is the transaction status still 'pending'?" popularity={21}>

If they are, check that you have selected the correct API version (v2.0) for your webhooks, and that (if you have it set) auto capture / capture delay is set to at least 0.02.

<FAQItem title="Shopify: Can I accept 3D Secure transactions?" popularity={21}>

If you use our onsite Shopify integration and want to use 3D Secure (3DS) authentication, Shopify requires you to use Cardinal Commerce as a third-party 3DS provider.

Shopify limits third-party payment providers from offering features like Apple Pay and Google Pay, so you can't use them with our plugin.

You will also need a Mada-capable payment processor to process Mada cards locally.
