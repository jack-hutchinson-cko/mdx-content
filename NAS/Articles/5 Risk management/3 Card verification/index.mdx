title: Card verification
account: NAS

Card verification allows you to accept and verify a cardholder's payment information without actually billing the customer for a charge. This type of authorization request is particularly useful if you're offering a trial period for a product or service.

For example, you may choose to collect credit card information during an initial registration process but offer a 30-day trial period before charging the customer's credit card. The cardholder's details are saved to their account, allowing you to charge the card when necessary.

## Verify a card

### The request

To verify a card, simply [set up a payment request](/payments/accept-payments/request-a-payment) with the `amount` field omitted or set to `0`.

### Request example

```json
{
  "source": {
    "type": "token",
    "token": "tok_yo2zfqgdnn4u7gswjbjmqt5mza"
  },
  "currency": "USD"
}
```
<TipBox variant="warning">

Some issuing banks do not support card verification and reject the charge request even if all card details are accurate. If the issuing bank refuses the card verification request, a follow-up request will be sent automatically with a $1 total amount (or the equivalent in the submitted processing currency).

</TipBox>

### The response 

If the `approved` field is `true` and the `status` field has a value of `Card Verified`, the verification was successful. If unsuccessful, the card may be invalid/expired or the account may have an insufficient available balance.

If you received a `202` response, a redirect is required (e.g., because 3D Secure authentication is required).

## One dollar authorization

If a standard card verification request (zero dollar authorization) is not successful, our payment gateway will automatically submit a new request to verify the card details. This follow-up request will automatically set the value to $1 (or the equivalent amount in the processing currency).

Once authorized, this payment will be automatically voided and the amount will be returned to the customer.

<TipBox variant="info">

Note that the value field is now returned as `100` in the response example, which, in this case, is equivalent to $1.
