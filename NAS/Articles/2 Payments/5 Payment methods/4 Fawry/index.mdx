Start accepting payments using Fawry, the dominant payment method in Egypt.

<TipBox>

Shoppers can now make Fawry payments via the myFawry app (<ExternalLink href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/myfawry/id1462911630?l=en">App Store</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fawry.myfawry&hl=en&gl=US">Google Play</ExternalLink>), rather than having to take their payment reference to a shop or ATM, meaning a better payment experience for both you and your customers.

</TipBox>

<TipBox variant="info">

To start accepting Fawry payments, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

### Endpoints

You can find the full list, as well as complete request and response examples, in our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe">API reference</ExternalLink>.

### Request example

```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "EGP",
  "source": {
    "type": "fawry",
    "description": "Fawry Demo Payment",
    "customer_mobile": "01058375055",
    "customer_email": "bruce@wayne-enterprises.com",
    "products": [
      {
        "product_id": "0123456789",
        "quantity": 1,
        "price": 1000,
        "description": "Fawry Demo Product"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Response example

If you receive a `202 Success` response containing a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful.

In addition, you will receive `payment_pending` and `payment_capture_pending` webhook notifications. And, when the customer completes the Fawry payment in a timely manner at a point of sale, you will get a `payment_captured` webhook notification to confirm that the payment has completed.

```json
{
  "id": "pay_xksrrfuzksge5gyyqubpgbn7gy",
  "status": "Pending",
  "customer": {
    "id": "cus_v65kd7q5tojehd23eftbaiktru"
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_xksrrfuzksge5gyyqubpgbn7gy"
    }
  }
}
```

<TipBox variant="info" title="Payment capture, expiration and cancellation">

The payment will remain pending for the duration that you agreed when you onboarded your business with Fawry, or until the date and time you set for `expires_on`. If the customer fails to complete the transaction at a point of sale by then, the payment will expire and you will receive a `payment_expired` webhook notification. If, for any reason, the payment gets canceled before being captured or expiring, you will receive the `payment_canceled` webhook notification instead. Make sure that your products and/or services are not shipped and/or provided before receiving confirmation of the capture.

</TipBox>

    }
  }
}
```

## Refund a payment

Fawry supports both partial (see note below for details) and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the <ExternalLink href="https://dashboard.checkout.com/login">Dashboard</ExternalLink> or by using the [refund API](/payments/manage-payments/refund-a-payment).

<TipBox variant="note">

Multiple partial refund actions may be taken on a Fawry payment if there is some amount left. In addition, Fawry refunds are **always rounded down to the nearest whole number**. For example, attempting to refund a payment amount of 10999 (EGP 109.99) will only refund 10900 (EGP 109.00).

## Fawry on mobile

You can offer the myFawry app for making payments. The app applies the same rules for both cash and credit card orders as kiosk and myFawry do not differ.

Refunds are made following the same steps as for cash orders:

1. When Fawry receives a refund request it sends a notification informing you that the proper action has been taken.
2. The customer receives an SMS with the reference code containing the OTP. The SMS is sent to the mobile number used in placing the order.
3. If the customer has payed with a credit card, the refund amount is sent to their credit card.
4. If the customer has payed with cash and request refund using the myFawry app, they receive a reference number they should use at a kiosk to obtain the refund.
