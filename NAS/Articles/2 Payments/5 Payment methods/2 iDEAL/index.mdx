Start accepting payments using <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/payment-methods/accept/ideal" >iDEAL</ExternalLink>, a favorite online payment method in The Netherlands.

iDEAL payments are made through direct online transfer from the customer's bank account to your merchant bank account. Customers can use their mobile banking app or online banking environment. As soon as a payment is made, iDEAL sends you an online payment guarantee so you can deliver goods and services right away.

<TipBox variant="info">

To start accepting iDEAL payments, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

</TipBox>

## Overview

iDEAL payments follow a two-step process:

1.  [Request a payment](/payments/payment-methods/i-deal#Request_a_payment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](/payments/payment-methods/i-deal#Redirect_the_customer)

### Request example

```json
    {
      "source": {
        "type": "ideal",
        "bic":"INGBNL2A",
        "description": "ORD50234E89",
        "language": "nl"
      },
      "amount": 2000,
      "currency": "EUR"
    }
```

<TipBox variant="info">

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, then we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

</TipBox>

### Response example

If you receive a `202 Success` response with a payment `id` and a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful.

```json
    {
      "id": "pay_yndlioum4gau3oizxihvzdgp4i",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_erquvsbcz2xunm5rrwd5clyfiy"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_yndlioum4gau3oizxihvzdgp4i"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/108659"
        }
      }
    }
```

---

## Redirect the customer

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the above response. The redirect transfers the customer to their bank's website where they are required to enter their authorization details; if successful, the payment can be approved.

<TipBox variant="note">

For security reasons, iDEAL forbids using custom-made in-app browsers for redirection. We recommend that you open the device’s default browser to display the redirect. If you do want to use an in-app web view, you must use <ExternalLink href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller" >SFSafariViewController</ExternalLink> for iOS or <ExternalLink href="https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs" >Chrome Custom Tabs</ExternalLink> for Android.

</TipBox>

Once completed, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of an iDEAL payment is **communicated only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

---

## Get details about a payment

You can use the `payment_id` found in the payment response, or the `cko-session-id` from the success/failure URL (e.g., `https://www.checkout.com/order/succeeded?cko-session-id=`) to retrieve details about the payment. To get a detailed view of all required and optional fields, see our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe" >API reference</ExternalLink>.

<TipBox variant="note">

The `cko-session-id` expires 15 minutes after being created.

## Testing iDEAL

<TipBox variant="note">

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account" >create a test account</ExternalLink>, and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or integrations engineer to activate iDEAL payments in the sandbox environment.

</TipBox>

### Test a payment request

1.  Create an iDEAL transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to the bank's website.
2.  Select _Confirm transaction_. You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.

<TipBox variant="note">

When you test a payment refund, the transaction is likely to remain in a deferred refund state. Contact us at <ExternalLink href="mailto:integration@checkout.com">integration@checkout.com</ExternalLink> to request triggering a simulation batch job that ensures the completion of the refund.

</TipBox>
