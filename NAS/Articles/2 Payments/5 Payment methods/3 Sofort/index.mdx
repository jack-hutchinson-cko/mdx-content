Start accepting payments using <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/payment-methods/accept/sofort" >Sofort</ExternalLink>, a favorite payment method in Europe.

Sofort is a direct payment method allowing your customers to use only their online banking details. Shortly after making a purchase, they receive a transaction confirmation so you can start processing the order immediately.

<TipBox variant="info">

To start accepting Sofort payments, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

## Overview

1.  [Request a payment](/payments/payment-methods/sofort#Request_a_payment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](/payments/payment-methods/sofort#Redirect_the_customer)

## Request a payment

Use the details below to set up your request. To get a detailed view of all required and optional fields, see our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe" >API reference</ExternalLink>.

### Request example

```json
    {
      "source": {
        "type": "sofort"
      },
      "amount": 1000,
      "currency": "EUR"
    }
```

<TipBox variant="info">

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

</TipBox>

### Response example

If you receive a `202 Success` response with a payment `id` and a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful.

```json
    {
      "id": "pay_ylcikkxovyjunekfu7a444mmvy",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_izfg7cwguvxuhaquys6qtof2f4"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_ylcikkxovyjunekfu7a444mmvy"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/108689"
        }
      }
    }
```

---

## Redirect the customer

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the above response. The redirect transfers the customer to their bank's website where they will be asked to enter their authorization details; if successful, the payment can be approved.

Once completed, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of a Sofort payment is **communicated only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

---

## Get details about a payment

You can retrieve details about an existing Sofort payment with the following request.

If the payment has been approved by a customer on the banking page, you’ll receive a `payment_capture_pending` webhook and the payment response will include the `bic`, `iban`, and `account_holder_name` fields. To get a detailed view of all required and optional fields, see our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe" >API reference</ExternalLink>.

## Refund a payment

Sofort supports both partial and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the <ExternalLink href="https://hub.checkout.com/v2https://hub.checkout.com/v2" >Hub</ExternalLink> or using the <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/#operation/refundAPayment" >refund endpoint</ExternalLink> of the Unified Payments API.

## Cancel a payment

<TipBox variant="info">

If the customer cancels or fails to complete the transaction at any point after the payment is created, it will automatically be canceled, and we’ll send you a `payment_canceled` webhook.
