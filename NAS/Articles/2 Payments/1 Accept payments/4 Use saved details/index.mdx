description: Process a payment using a previously-obtained source ID.
---

There's no need to request your customersâ€™ card details for every payment. Instead, you can use a source ID to securely process their subsequent payments without having to re-enter their card number. It's simple, fast, and secure!

<TipBox variant="note">

The `source ID` must be one received in response to a card payment request. An ID received in response to a network token payment request will not work.

</TipBox>

---

## Request a payment using an ID

### Before you start

Make sure you have your source ID at hand. You can find this in the `source` object of your card payment request's response. It is prefixed by `src_`.

### The request

Use the details below to set up your request.

### Endpoints

<TipBox variant="info" title="IPv4 or IPv6 addresses?">

The optional `payment_ip` field, which is used by our risk engine to check the customer's IP address, _only accepts IPv4 addresses_.

</TipBox>

### Request example

```json
{
  "source": {
    "type": "id",
    "id": "src_nwd3m4in3hkuddfpjsaevunhdy"
  },
  "amount": 6500,
  "currency": "USD",
  "reference": "ORD-5023-4E89",
  "metadata": {
    "udf1": "TEST123",
    "coupon_code": "NY2018",
    "partner_id": 123989
  }
}
```
### The response

Use the `approved` field to check whether or not the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). If your authorization was not successful, it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.

If you received a `202` response, the payment requires a redirect. For example, if the payment is 3D Secure.

<TipBox variant="success">

The following pages can help you understand the response message:

- [CVV codes and descriptions](/resources/codes/cvv-response-codes)
- [AVS codes](/resources/codes/avs-codes)
- [Response codes](/resources/codes/response-codes) (if the authorization was unsuccessful)

</TipBox>

### Response example

The possible values for the `status` field include `Authorized`, `Pending`, `Card Verified`, `Captured`, `Declined`, or `Paid`. Note that `Pending` only applies to 3D Secure payments.
