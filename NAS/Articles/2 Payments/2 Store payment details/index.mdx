Securely store and manage customer details and payment information in our Vault. You can reuse these stored details for future payments, so your customers don't have to re-enter their payment information each time they make a purchase.

## Customers and payment instruments

You can store two sorts of objects in the Vault: **customers** and **payment instruments**.

### Customers

A customer object contains the details of a particular customer, like their name, email, and phone number. Each customer has a unique ID (for example, `cus_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb44`), to which you can associate multiple payment instruments. You can also set a default payment instrument for the customer, which will be charged if you use the customer ID as the source when making a payment request.

### Payment instruments

A payment instrument allows you to store the details of a customer's payment card or bank account. Each payment instrument has a unique ID (for example, `src_nwd3m4in3hkuddfpjsaevunhdy`), which you can use as the source or destination for payments. An instrument can only be associated with one customer.
