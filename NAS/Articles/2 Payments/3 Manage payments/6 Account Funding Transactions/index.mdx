The Unified Payments API can be used to perform Account Funding Transactions (AFTs). AFTs are a type of pull payment used primarily to fund a wallet.

<TipBox variant="info">

AFTs are supported by Mastercard and Visa, but whether just one or both card schemes are available depends on the region. Contact your Customer Success Manager for more details.

### Request example

```json
{
  "source": {
    "type": "token",
    "token": "tok_4gzeau5o2uqubbk6fufs3m7p54",
  },
  "amount": 100,
  "currency": "USD",
  "processing": {
    "aft": true,
  },
  "recipient": {

    "country": "GB"
  }
}
```

### Response example

Use the `approved` field to check whether or not the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). If your authorization was not successful, it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.

If you received a `202` response, the payment requires a redirect. For example, if the payment is 3D Secure.

<TipBox variant="tip">

The following pages can help you understand the response message:

- [CVV codes and descriptions](/resources/codes/cvv-response-codes)
- [AVS codes](/resources/codes/avs-codes)
- [Response codes](/resources/codes/response-codes) (if the authorization was unsuccessful)

</TipBox>

The possible values for the status field include `Authorized`, `Captured`, `Card Verified`, `Declined`, and `Pending`. Note that `Pending` only applies to 3D Secure payments.
