## Server-to-server

For server-to-server communication, we support two different mechanisms for authentication:

- [OAuth 2.0 client credentials](/resources/api-authentication/o-auth-2-0-client-credentials)
- [API keys](/resources/api-authentication/api-keys)

<TipBox variant="success">

Our Customer Success team can help you decide which of the two options is best suited to your requirements.

## Client-side
