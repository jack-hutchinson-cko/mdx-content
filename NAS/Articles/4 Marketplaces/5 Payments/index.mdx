title: Accept a payment on behalf of your sub-entities
account: NAS
---

Once your sub-entity's payment capabilities have been enabled, you can process payments on behalf of them through our [Unified Payments API](/payments/request-a-payment). 

On this page, we will walk through how you can request a payment on behalf of: 
* [a single sub-entity](#Request_a_payment_for_a_single_sub-entity); or
* [multiple sub-entities](#Request_a_payment_for_multiple_sub-entities) <span style={{display: "inline-block"}}><StatusTag type="Marketplaces only" /></span>


## Payment Facilitators vs Marketplaces

* If you are a Payment Facilitator, you process payments on behalf of a [single sub-entity](#Request_a_payment_for_a_single_sub-entity). 
* If you are a Marketplace, you can process payments on behalf of your sub-entities using both options.

## Request a payment for a single sub-entity 

When processing a payment on behalf of a single sub-entity, you just need to create a payment request for the total purchase amount. Include all relevant fields using our <RequestTag type="POST"/>`/payments` endpoint. See our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/" >API reference</ExternalLink> for all required and optional fields.

To associate this payment with the correct sub-entity, use the `marketplace` object and provide the ID in the `sub_entity_id` field.

<TipBox>

The sub-entity ID is returned during the [onboarding process](/marketplaces/onboarding).

</TipBox>

```json
{
  "amount":1000,
  "currency":"GBP",
  "reference":"ORD-5023",
  "description":"Three chocolate donuts",
  "capture":true,
  "source":{
    "type":"card",
    "number":"4242424242424242",
    "expiry_month":11,
    "expiry_year":2024,
    "cvv":"100"
  },
  "processing_channel_id":"pc_yghfzjebuiwelerjsk3atodrey",
  "marketplace":{
    "sub_entity_id":"ent_vv2jjkuf2gzj5tcw2x7ptua7zy"
  }
}

```

<TipBox variant="info">

`processing_channel_id` corresponds to a specific MCC that you are set up to process payments for. Your processing channel IDs will be provided to you after we have completed your setup.

</TipBox>

## Request a payment for multiple sub-entities

<StatusTag type="Marketplaces only"/>

When a customer uses your platform to buy items from multiple sub-entities, you need to request one payment from the customer, and then split that amount appropriately across the different sub-entities. This is known as a **split payment**. You can also split or add a commission that could be both fixed and variable.

---

### How to split a payment

Include all relevant fields using our <RequestTag type="POST"/>`/payments` endpoint. See our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/" >API reference</ExternalLink> for all required and optional fields.

In the `marketplace` object, include the `sub_entities` array. This is an array of objects, where each object specifies:
* The ID of the sub-entity.
* The amount for that sub-entity.
* An optional commission for your platform.
* An optional reference to identify the split later.

The sum of all split amounts must be equal to the payment amount. 

<TipBox>

The sub-entity ID is returned during the [onboarding process](/marketplaces/onboarding).

</TipBox>

### Split payments example scenario

A customer makes a purchase of £100. The split payment contains three splits, which look like:
1. Sub-entity A: £30 for a shirt
2. Sub-entity B: £50 for trainers
3. Sub-entity C: £20 for socks

On top of this, you also charge a commission to sub-entities using your platform. You can specify a fixed amount or a percentage. You can also specify a percentage in addition to a fixed amount, depending on your business model. The commission will be applied to each split, and cannot exceed the split amount. 

<TipBox>

Remember our APIs work in the [minor currency unit](/resources/calculating-the-amount).

</TipBox>

### Request example

In the example request below, we take the split shown above and demonstrate three ways you can split the payment and specify commission for your platform:
* **Fixed commission amount**: Charge the sub-entity in this split a fixed commissiong amount of £2. This sub-entity would receive £28, and you would receive £2 in your currency account.
* **Commission percentage**: Charge the sub-entity in this split a fee of 1.5%. This sub-entity would have 1.5% of £50 deducted, so would receive £49.25. You would receive 75p in your currency account.
* **Fixed commission amount + commission percentage**: Charge the sub-entity in this split a fee of 1.5%, plus a fixed fee of £2. This sub-entity would have 1.5% of £20 deducted, plus another £2 deducted, so would receive £17.70. You would receive £2.30 in your currency account.

<TipBox variant="info">

You can also use this method on a single payment (not split) to collect commission.

  }
}

## Response examples

If you receive a successful response, the payment will be automatically associated with the correct sub-entity. A sub-entity's funds will be held in their currency account (as per their default holding currency set up during [onboarding](/marketplaces/onboarding)). Your commissions will be held in your platform's currency account (set up during your own onboarding with our Marketplaces solution).


<TipBox variant="note">

All Checkout fees for processing payments will be charged to you (the platform).
