This guide demonstrates the complete process from onboarding a sub-entity to processing payments on its behalf. Select _Individual_ or _Company_ below to see the specific steps for each.

## Before you begin

Check you've completed the following steps before starting your integration.

- Your account is able to onboard sub-entities.
- You have your `client_id` and `client_secret`, so you can generate access tokens with the required scopes. See our [authentication workflow](/resources/api-authentication/o-auth-2-0-client-credentials) for more information.
- You have your processing channel ID(s), which will be required throughout the process.
- You have configured your webhooks and subscribed to the relevant events through our [Workflow API](/workflows).
- You are familiar with our [account structure](/marketplaces/account-structure).


## Step 1: Onboard your sub-entities

<tabs>
<tab title="Individual">

Vendors, retailers and service providers on your platform are represented by sub-entities in our solution. A sub-entity is used to collect the information we require to perform due diligence checks, as well as capture certain preferences.

In this step we’re going to walk through the complete onboarding of a sub-entity:

* Onboard with the minimum required information
* Keep up to date with webhook notifications

---

### Step 1a: Onboard a sub-entity

<TipBox variant="info">

We will trigger our checks only when we have all of the information required to conduct them. If our due diligence checks pass, payment capabilities for this sub-entity will be enabled.

</TipBox>

We will use the example of **Daniel’s Donuts** – a donut seller (who is a sole proprietor) on our fictional platform, Desserts Delivered.

Use <RequestTag type="post" />`/marketplace/entities` to create a sub-entity representing Daniel’s Donuts.

### Request

```json
{
    "reference": "0123456",
    "contact_details": {
        "phone": {
            "number": "2345678910"
        }
    },
    "profile": {
        "urls": ["https://www.daniels-donuts.com"],
        "mccs": [5814]
    },
    "individual": {
        "first_name": "Daniel",
        "last_name": "Yubi",
        "trading_name": "Daniel's Donuts",
        "national_tax_id": "1234567",
        "registered_address": {
            "address_line1": "90 Tottenham Court Road",
            "city": "London",
            "zip": "W1T4TJ",
            "country": "GB"
        }
    }
}
```

<TipBox variant="info">

You will only be able to specify the `individual.registered_address.country` and `profile.mccs` to those that were configured for your scope during onboarding.

</TipBox>

A successful response will include a unique sub-entity `id`, which you should store for future requests. Additionally, the response has the `capabilities object`, which shows you whether the sub-entity’s capabilities are enabled or not. Capabilities only get enabled once specific due diligence checks have been run and passed.

You will also notice there is a status field set to `pending`. This is because due diligence checks haven't been completed yet.

```json
{
  "id":"ent_vv2jjkuf2gzj5tcw2x7ptua7zy",
  "reference":"0123456",
  "status": "pending",
  "capabilities":{
    "payments":{
      "enabled":false
    },
    "payouts":{
      "enabled":false
    }
  },
  "requirements_due": [],
  "_links":{
    "self":{
      "href":"https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/marketplace/entities/ent_vv2jjkuf2gzj5tcw2x7ptua7zy"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the `sub_entity_created` webhook notification will also be sent.

That’s all it takes to create and trigger due diligence checks for a sub-entity!

---

### Step 1b: Handle due diligence result and capability changes

Once we have conducted our due diligence checks, we will inform you of the outcome via [webhook notification](/workflows). You should expect to receive the `vmss_passed / vmss_failed` and `match_passed / match_failed` event types. Both VMSS and Match checks must pass to pass CSS checks successfully. Unless one of our `legal_name` fail triggers is used for testing purposes, due diligence will always pass in Sandbox.

For **Daniel’s Donuts**, we receive the pass event types (`vmss_passed` and `match_passed`) with the following payload:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "vmss_passed",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_ahlzzbn2lepib3jigq4tbj7rju",
    "reference": "123456",
    "legal_name": "Daniel Yubi"
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

If due diligence is passed, we will enable the sub-entity’s **payment** capability. You should expect to receive the `payments_enabled` event type.

For **Daniel’s Donuts**, we receive `payments_enabled` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "payments_enabled",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_ahlzzbn2lepib3jigq4tbj7rju",
    "reference": "123456",
    "legal_name": "Daniel Yubi"
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

<TipBox variant="note">

We will re-trigger due diligence checks if any of the required information is later updated. If any subsequent checks fail and you receive the `vmss_failed` and / or `match_failed` notification, this will be followed by `payments_disabled` webhook notification.

### Step 1a: Onboard a sub-entity

<TipBox variant="info">

To provide greater flexibility, we don’t require you to provide all of the data required for due diligence checks upfront; you can onboard a sub-entity with the minimum required information and then enrich it later through updates. We will trigger our checks only when we have all of the information required to conduct them. If our due diligence checks pass, the **payment** capability for this sub-entity will be enabled. Read more about this on our [onboarding information page](/marketplaces/onboarding).

We will use the example of **The Cake Shop** – a cake seller on our fictional platform, Desserts Delivered.

Use <RequestTag type="post" />`/marketplace/entities` to create a sub-entity representing The Cake Shop.

    ]
  }
}
```

<TipBox variant="info">

You will only be able to specify the `company.principal_address.country` and `profile.mccs` to those that were configured for your scope during onboarding.

### Response

A successful response will include a unique sub-entity `id`, which you should store for future requests. Additionally, the response has the `capabilities` object, which shows you whether the sub-entity’s capabilities are enabled or not. Capabilities only get enabled once specific due diligence checks have been run and passed.

You will also notice there is a status field set to `pending`. This is because due diligence checks haven't been completed yet. Read more [about statuses](/marketplaces/onboarding#Sub-entity_status).

```json

  "reference": "678910",
  "status": "requirements_due",
  "capabilities": {
    "payments": {
      "enabled": false
    },
    "payouts": {

    }
  },
  "requirements_due": [
    {
      "field": "company.representatives",

    }
  }
}
```

Note that the `sub_entity_created` webhook notification will also be sent.

That’s all it takes to create a sub-entity!

### Step 1b: Handle due diligence result and capabilities changes

Once we have conducted our due diligence checks, we will inform you of the outcome via [webhook notification](/workflows/webhook-event-types). You should expect to receive the `vmss_passed` / `vmss_failed` and `match_passed` / `match_failed` event types. Both VMSS and Match checks must pass for the CSS checks to be successful. Unless one of our `legal_name` fail triggers is used for testing purposes, due diligence will always pass in Sandbox.

For **The Cake Shop**, we receive the pass event types. For example `vmss_passed` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "vmss_passed",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
    "reference": "123456789101112",
    "legal_name": "The Cake Shop Inc."
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

If due diligence is passed, we will enable the sub-entity’s **payment** capability. You should expect to receive the `payments_enabled` event type.

For **The Cake Shop**, we receive `payments_enabled` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "payments_enabled",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
    "reference": "123456789101112",
    "legal_name": "The Cake Shop Inc."
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

<TipBox variant="note">

We will re-trigger due diligence checks if any of the required information is later updated. If any subsequent checks fail and you receive the `vmss_failed` and / or `match_failed` notification, this will be followed by `payments_disabled` webhook notification type.

</TipBox>

## Step 2: Accept payments

<tabs>
<tab title="Individual">

Now that your sub-entity's payments capabilities have been enabled, you’re ready to start using it. Our Unified Payments API enables you to process payments on behalf of a sub-entity by specifying its `id` in the `marketplace.sub_entity_id` field when using <RequestTag type="post" /> `/payments.`

We’ll use **Daniel’s Donut's** `id` from step 1 to process a payment for £10 on its behalf. An `id` will start with `ent` and looks like `ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli`.

<TipBox variant="info">

Funds will be routed and held in your platform’s currency accounts as per the preferences agreed for your platform during onboarding. In this example all payments are being routed to GBP.

}
```

---

### Response

Use the `approved` field to check whether the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). The `balances` object provides an overview of the payment’s balances, which helps you determine the amount that can be used for each subsequent action on the payment.

## Scheduled payouts

All funds will be settled to your platform’s designated bank account(s) as per the frequency agreed during onboarding.

The distribution of funds to your sub-entities and collection of fees for your platform are both done outside of our solution.

If you wish to understand more about the routing and holding of funds, you can optionally process [balance reports](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/balance-reports) to retrieve the closing available balance of your currency account(s) on a daily basis. If you’d like to reconcile transactions for each sub-entity, you may process daily [financial actions](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports) reports to retrieve this breakdown.

## FAQs

<Accordion title="Why haven't my sub-entity's capabilities been enabled?">

Capabilities are enabled once due diligence checks have been completed. If you haven't received a webhook notification – either `{check}_passed` or `{check}_failed` – it is likely there are outstanding requirements due. Please check our onboarding information page to confirm you have sent all the required information.

If you have provided all the information, and more than two hours have passed, please allow up to 48 hours to review the sub-entity. In rare cases, we may have to perform checks manually, which can delay our response.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is there an invalid scope error?">

You will only be able to specify the `company.principal_address.country`, `profile.mccs` and `profile.default_holding_currency` to those that were configured for your scope during onboarding. For example, if your processing scope is only MCC `5311`, you cannot change this to `5411`. If you’re getting an invalid for scope error, you’ll need change the value(s) to something in your scope, or get in touch with us to update your scope.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I didn't specify a default currency, but one was set anyway. Why?">

If omitted, `profile.default_holding_currency` will be set to the default preference specified during your onboarding.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why can't I update my sub-entity's default holding currency?">

`profile.default_holding_currency` is not currently updatable. If you need to change this, please get in touch.

</Accordion>
