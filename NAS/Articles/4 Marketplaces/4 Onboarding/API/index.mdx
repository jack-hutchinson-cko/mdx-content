## Select your account type 

Your account type will be determined during onboarding and depends on whether you require payment capabilities (`lite`), or payment and payout capabilities (`full`).

<CardWrapper cardsInRow={{ desktop: 2, mobile: 1 }}>
<Card variant="media" title="Lite" imgSrc="/NAS/Marketplaces/onboard-sub-entities.svg" href="/marketplaces/onboarding/api/lite">

`Lite` account types process payments **only**. All funds are settled to your platform as per the frequency agreed during onboarding.

</Card>

<Card variant="media" title="Full" imgSrc="/NAS/Marketplaces/onboard-sub-entities.svg" href="/marketplaces/onboarding/api/full">

`Full` account types can processs payments and payouts capabilities on behalf of their sub-entities. Funds are paid out on demand by your platform directly to the bank accounts of your sub-entities.

</Card>
</CardWrapper>

## Sub-entity status

To provide you with visibility to what's going on with your sub-entities, our API responses include a `status` field.

You can also subscribe to the status [webhook notification](/workflows) to keep up to date with any asynchronous changes.

<tabs>
<tab title='Requirements due' active>

If we're expecting you to provide us with more information, your sub-entity will have a status of `requirements_due`. With this status, the `requirements_due` array will also be populated to inform you of the information that is missing.

<TipBox variant="tip">

Use the [information required table](/marketplaces/onboarding) to find out what information is required to trigger due diligence checks.

### Example response

In this example, we have created a company sub-entity without any representatives or a registered address.


```json withBorder=false
{
   "id": "ent_vjmdzvijizs7o26kiuiakywvyi",
   "reference": "tmvhWvvZfFSkJy4",
   "status": "requirements_due",
   "capabilities": {
       "payments": {
           "enabled": false
       },
       "payouts": {
           "enabled": false
       }
   },
   "requirements_due": [
       {
           "field": "company.representatives",
           "reason": "required"
       },
       {
           "field": "company.registered_address",
           "reason": "required"
       }
   ],
   "_links": {
       "self": {
           "href": "https://api.checkout.com/marketplace/entities/ent_vjmdzvijizs7o26kiuiakywvyi"
       }
   }
}
```

</tab>
<tab title='Pending'>

We will only trigger due diligence checks when we have all the [information required](#Aboutonboarding-information). Once the checks are triggered, the sub-entity's status will be `pending`.

We may make changes to this sub-entity's capabilities based on the outcome of these checks.

```json withBorder=false
{
   "id": "ent_vjmdzvijizs7o26kiuiakywvyi",
   "reference": "tmvhWvvZfFSkJy4",
   "status": "pending",
   "capabilities": {
       "payments": {
           "enabled": false
       },
       "payouts": {
           "enabled": false
       }
   },
   "requirements_due": [],
   "_links": {
       "self": {
           "href": "https://api.checkout.com/marketplace/entities/ent_vjmdzvijizs7o26kiuiakywvyi"
       }
   }
}
```

</tab>
<tab title='Active'>

If the due diligence checks have passed, we will enable the sub-entity's payments or payouts capabilities, which will give that sub-entity a status of `active`. This means there are no outstanding requirements at this time.

<TipBox variant="info">

- This status change is asynchronous (happening behind the scenes), so you can optionally subscribe to the `status_changed` [webhook notification](/workflows/webhook-event-types) to keep up to date or see the status by retrieving the sub-entity.
- If you update information after this point, new checks will be triggered and the status of this sub-entity will go back to `pending`.

### Example webhook notification

```json withBorder=false
{
   "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
   "type": "status_changed",
   "version": "1.0.0",
   "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
   "data": {
     "sub_entity_id": "ent_vjmdzvijizs7o26kiuiakywvyi",
     "status": "active"
     "reference": "tmvhWvvZfFSkJy4",
     "legal_name": "Super Hero Masks Inc."
   },
   "_links": {
       "self": {
          "href": "https://api.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
        }
    }
}
```
</tab>
<tab title='Rejected'>

If due diligence checks do not pass, we will disable the sub-entity's payment and payouts capabilities. This status will change from `pending` to `rejected`. A sub-entity is rejected if we have identified reasons during our due diligence checks â€“ this decision is final and you will not be able to resume onboarding.

To challenge the direction, please contact us directly.

<TipBox variant="info">

- This status change is asynchronous (happening behind the scenes), so you can optionally subscribe to the `status_changed` [webhook notification](/workflows/webhook-event-types) to keep up to date or see the status by retrieving the sub-entity.
- An attempt to update a rejected sub-entity will return a 442 response with the error code `status_invalid`.
