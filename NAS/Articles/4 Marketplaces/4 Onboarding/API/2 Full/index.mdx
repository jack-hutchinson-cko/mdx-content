title: Onboard a sub-entity with our Marketplace API (full)
account: NAS
---

This process should be followed for those on the full account type for our marketplaces solution. We have another page for [lite sub-entity onboarding.](/marketplaces/onboarding/api/lite)

On this page, we will walk through the complete onboarding of a sub-entity:

- Onboard a sub-entity
- Update a sub-entity
- Retrieve a sub-entity
- Upload an identity document
- Handle due diligence notifications

<TipBox>

Don't want to use code? You can [onboard sub-entities using our friendly user interface](/marketplaces/onboarding/dashboard) in the Dashboard.

</TipBox>

## Before you begin

[Configure your webhooks](/workflows) and subscribe to:

- `sub_entity_created`
- `full_dd_passed` and `full_dd_failed`
- `payouts_enabled` and `payouts_disabled`
- `payments_enabled` and `payments_disabled`
- `status_changed`

To get a detailed view of all required and optional fields, see our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#tag/Marketplace/paths/~1marketplace~1entities~1{id}/put" >API Reference</ExternalLink>

### Response examples

<tabs>
<tab title="201 - Sub-entity onboard successfully">

A successful response will include a unique sub-entity `id`, which you should store for future requests.

Additionally, the response has the `capabilities` object, which shows you whether the sub-entity’s capabilities are enabled or not. Capabilities only get enabled once specific [due diligence checks](/marketplaces/about-onboarding) have been run and passed.


```json withBorder=false
{
  "id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
  "reference": "123456789101112",
  "status": "requirements_due",
  "capabilities": {
    "payments": {
      "enabled": false
     },
     "payouts": {

    }
  }
}
```

<Accordion isBoldTitle={true} title={"Why haven't my sub-entity's capabilities been enabled?"}>

Capabilities are enabled once due diligence checks have been completed. If you haven't received a webhoook notification – either `{check}_passed` or `{check}_failed` – it is likely there are outstanding requirements due. Please check our [onboarding information page](/marketplaces/onboarding) to confirm you have sent all the required information.

If you have provided all the information, we may be completing a manual review.

</Accordion>

</tab>
<tab title="409 - Conflict">

The `reference` you provide needs to be unique across all of your sub-entities. If you receive a 409, you are trying to onboard a sub-entity with a `reference` that has already been used. Try again with another `reference`.

### Webhook notification example

Once your sub-entity has been successfully created, we will send you a `sub_entity_created` webhook notification, which will look similar to:

```json withBorder=false
{
  "id": "evt_jqv4f6zedawetlilolhqun6m4m",
  "source": "marketplace",
  "type": "sub_entity_created",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-20T16:48:17.142+00:00",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_gavuonbau65upa75f77rar4yuu",
    "reference": "5uperher01234",
    "legal_name": "Super Hero Masks Inc."
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_jqv4f6zedawetlilolhqun6m4m"
    }
  }
}
```

## Update a sub-entity

Use this endpoint to update all fields under the `contact_details`, `profile`, and `company` objects. To fulfil due diligence requirements, your sub-entity needs to provide identity documents; this endpoint also allows you to add identification documents.

---

### Add an identification document

Use our [Files API](/marketplaces/onboarding/api/full/upload-a-file) to upload identity documentation. When you upload a file, the API returns an `id` that represents that file, which you can use to attach identity documentation when creating or updating your sub-entity. 

All you need to include is the `identification.documentation` object in your request, with the following pieces of information:

- **Type:** Read more about [what types are accepted.](/marketplaces/onboarding/api/full/upload-a-file)
- **Front:** Required for **all** identification types. This should be the `id` returned when you uploaded the file.
- **Back:** Only required if the type is **not** a passport. This should be the `id` returned when you uploaded the file.

<TipBox variant='note'>

**Adding a document**

Providing an identity document is the last step before triggering due diligence checks. To prevent multiple due diligence checks, please add all representatives before uploading their identification documents.

## Retrieve a sub-entity

The response allows you to retrieve all data that has been provided about the sub-entity, including its capabilities, which informs you whether this sub-entity can process payments or not.

Store this information, as we use it in the next step to upload identity documents.

<Accordion isBoldTitle={true} title={`I didn't specify a default currency, but one was set anyway. Why?`}>

We require `profile.default_holding_currency` for full account types, so we set a default in case you would like to change to the full account type. This doesn't have any impact on the way that funds will be routed and held for this sub-entity.

## Handle due diligence notifications

Once we have conducted our due diligence checks, we will inform you of the outcome via [webhook notification](/workflows). You should expect to receive the following event types: 

- `full_dd_passed` / `full_dd_failed`

Due diligence will always pass in the Sandbox environment, unless one of our `legal_name` fail triggers is used for simulation.

On occasion, our team will need to manually review a sub-entity. Please see [about onboarding](/marketplaces/about-onboarding) for more information.

### Due diligence webhook example

<TipBox>

We've described the different webhook notifications on our [webhook event type page](/workflows/).

</TipBox>

<tabs>
<tab title='full_dd_passed'>

```json withBorder=false
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "full_dd_passed",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
    "reference": "123456789101112",
    "legal_name": "The Cake Shop Inc."
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

</tab>
<tab title='full__dd_failed'>

```json withBorder=false
{
  id: "evt_u2bs7wtytscexfrbz47qmgp62i",
  type: "full_dd_failed",
  version: "1.0.0",
  created_on: "2021-03-22T12:04:44.5996515Z",
  data: {
    reason_codes: [
      "declined"
    ],
    sub_entity_id: "ent_3dgnkienrssoudk62llqqvj6qu",
    reference: "l7WtKSkVK8VxM3o",
    legal_name: "Smoke simulator_match_fail Company"
  },
  _links: {
    self: {
      href: "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_u2bs7wtytscexfrbz47qmgp62i"
    }
  }
}
```

</tab>
</tabs>

If due diligence is passed, we will enable the sub-entity’s **payments** and **payouts** capabilities. You should expect to receive the `payments_enabled` and `payout_enabled` event types.

<TipBox variant='info'>

We will re-trigger due diligence checks if any of the required information is later updated. If any subsequent checks fail and you receive the `full_dd_failed` notification, this will be followed by `payments_disabled` and `payouts_disabled` webhook notifications.

</TipBox>
