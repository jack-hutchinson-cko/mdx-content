title: Onboard a sub-entity with our Marketplace API (lite)
account: NAS
---

This process should be followed for those on the full account type for our marketplaces solution. We have another page for [full sub-entity onboarding](/marketplaces/onboarding/api/full).

On this page, we will walk through the complete onboarding of a sub-entity:

- Onboard a sub-entity
- Update a sub-entity
- Retrieve a sub-entity
- Handle due diligence notifications
- Testing

<TipBox>

Don't want to use code? You can [onboard sub-entities using our friendly user interface](/marketplaces/onboarding/dashboard) in the Dashboard.

</TipBox>

## Before you begin

[Configure your webhooks](/workflows) and subscribe to:

- `sub_entity_created`
- `vmss_passed` and `vmss_failed`
- `match_passed` and `match_failed`
- `payments_enabled` and `payments_disabled`
- `status_changed`

To get a detailed view of all required and optional fields, see our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#tag/Marketplace/paths/~1marketplace~1entities~1{id}/put" >API reference</ExternalLink>.

### Response examples

<tabs>
<tab title='201 - Sub-entity onboard successfully'>

A successful response will include a unique sub-entity `id`, which you should store for future requests.

Additionally, the response has the `capabilities` object, which shows you whether the sub-entity’s capabilities are enabled or not. Capabilities only get enabled once specific [due diligence checks](/marketplaces/onboarding) have been run and passed.

```json withBorder=false
{
  "id": "ent_aotj3m5ggi2ecpfmxu4su5ctx4",
  "reference": "MnuaOoPZanDbJwT",
	"status": "requirements_due",
    "capabilities": {
        "payments": {
            "enabled": false
        },
		"payouts": {
            "enabled": false
        },
    },
    "requirements_due": [

        }
    }
}
```

<Accordion isBoldTitle={true} title={`Why haven't my sub-entity's capabilities been enabled`}>

Capabilities are enabled once due diligence checks have been completed. If you haven't received a webhoook notification – either `{check}_passed` or `{check}_failed` – it is likely there are outstanding requirements due. Please check our [onboarding information page](/marketplaces/about-onboarding) to confirm you have sent all the required information.

If you have provided all the information, we may be completing a manual review.

</Accordion>

</tab>
<tab title='409 - Conflict'>

The `reference` you provide needs to be unique across all of your sub-entities. If you receive a `409`, you are trying to onboard a sub-entity with a `reference` that has already been used. Try again with another `reference`.

```json withBorder=false
{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "https://marketplace.cko-qa.ckotech.co/entities/ent_lcvk7ay5zcglzvda6n7o5ws2hq"
        }
    }
}
```
</tab>
<tab title='422 - Invalid data was sent'>

When you receive a `422`, please check the API request to make sure you've included all of the required values. You can see our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#tag/Marketplace/paths/~1marketplace~1entities/post" >API reference</ExternalLink> for a full overview.

### Webhook notification example

Once your sub-entity has been successfully created, we will send you a `sub_entity_created` webhook notification, which will look similar to:

```json withBorder=false
{
  "id": "evt_jqv4f6zedawetlilolhqun6m4m",
  "source": "marketplace",
  "type": "sub_entity_created",
  "timestamp": "2020-08-20T16:48:17.142+00:00",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_gavuonbau65upa75f77rar4yuu",
    "reference": "5uperher01234",
    "legal_name": "Super Hero Masks Inc."

      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_jqv4f6zedawetlilolhqun6m4m"
    }
  }
}
```

## Update a sub-entity

You can update all fields under the `contact_details`, `profile`, and `company` objects.

<TipBox variant='note'>

When you update a sub-entity, we may conduct further due diligence checks when necessary. During these checks, your payment capabilities will remain unchanged.

## Retrieve a sub-entity

If you need to retrieve a sub-entity's details, you can use our Get sub-entity details endpoint. Just include the id of the sub-entity returned during the initial onboarding in your request. For example, `https://api.checkout.com/marketplace/entities/ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli` .

## Handle due diligence notifications

Once we have conducted our due diligence checks, we will inform you of the outcome via [webhook notification](/workflows). You should expect to receive the following event types: 

- `vmss_passed` / `vmss_failed`
- `match_passed` / `match_failed`

Due diligence will always pass in the Sandbox environment, unless one of our `legal_name` fail triggers is used for simulation.

On occasion, our team will need to manually review a sub-entity. Please see [about onboarding](/marketplaces/about-onboarding) for more information.

### Due diligence webhook example

If due diligence is passed (VMSS and Match), we will enable the sub-entity’s **payments** capability. You should expect to receive the `payments_enabled` event type. 

<TipBox variant='info'>

We will re-trigger due diligence checks if `legal_name`, `trading_name` and `profile.urls` is later updated. If any subsequent checks fail and you receive the `vmss_failed` or `match_failed` notification, this will be followed by a `payments_disabled` webhook notification.

</TipBox>

### Payments enabled webhook example

## Testing

You can simulate different scenarios when onboarding sub-entities. Similar to simulating payment scenarios using specific card numbers, you can use certain values in the `legal_name` field of your onboarding request. This will trigger specific outcomes regarding card scheme screening, as well as the payment capabilities of a sub-entity.

Including a company name in the `legal_name` field will trigger positive VMSS and MATCH checks, and will enable payment capabilities. The simulator only accepts fail triggers:


<Table>
{/* legal_name should be `legal_name`,but it's not possible at the moment due to the inability to write the markdown inside a string*/}
<TableHead headers={['Trigger to be added in legal_name', 'Card scheme screening','Payment capabilities']} />
<TableBody>

<TableRow>
<TableCell>

`simulator_match_fail`
`simulator_vmss_fail`

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

Both the VMSS and the MATCH checks fail.

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

Remain disabled.

</TableCell>
</TableRow>

<TableRow>
<TableCell>

`simulator_vmss_fail`

The VMSS check fails, but the MATCH check passes.
