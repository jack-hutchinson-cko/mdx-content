There are different options available to you depending on what account type you were onboarded with. If you're unsure which account type you are, please see our [account structure page](/marketplaces/account-structure) or <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/contact-us" >contact us</ExternalLink>.

Choose your account from the headings below to find out what payout options are available to you.

### Scheduled payouts

All funds will be settled to your platform’s designated bank account(s) as per the frequency agreed during onboarding.

The distribution of funds to your sub-entities and collection of fees for your platform are both done outside of our solution.

You can optionally process daily [balance reports](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/balance-reports) and [financial actions](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports) reports to retrieve the closing available balance of your currency account(s) and perform reconciliation.

### Make payouts with Checkout.com

Sub-entity funds will be paid out on-demand by your platform directly to the bank accounts of your sub-entities. 

Funds are distributed to your sub-entities inside our solution, so sub-entity bank account details must be captured as payment instruments to be later used as the destination in payout requests. 

Platform fees can also be collected by performing on-demand payouts to your own bank account.
