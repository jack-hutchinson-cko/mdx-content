title: Make a payout with our Marketplaces solution
account: NAS
---

`Full` account types can make on-demand payouts directly to the sub-entity's local bank account.

Once you've successfully processed a payment on behalf of the sub-entity, you will have funds that need to be paid out to them. You will also want to collect your platform fees.

On this page, we will walk through the how to pay out to a sub-entity:

- Retrieve currency account balance
- Make a payout
- Collect platform fees

## Before you begin 

Make sure you have [connected bank account details to your sub-entity](/marketplaces/onboarding/api/full/manage-bank-accounts).

## Retrieve currency account balance

We are currently working on exposing real-time currency account balances through an API, and hope to offer this functionality soon.

In the meantime, you can [process balance](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/balance-reports) reports to retrieve the closing available balance of your currency account(s) on a daily basis. If you’d like to reconcile transactions for each sub-entity, you can process daily [financial actions](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports) reports to retrieve this breakdown. 

## Make sub-entity payouts

Our Unified Payments API already enables you to make payouts to a sub-entity using the payments endpoint.

Making a payout is very similar to a payment, but there are a few more <StatusTag type="required" display="inline" /> fields. For a list of all possible fields you can include in a payout, see our <ExternalLink href="https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#operation/requestAPaymentOrPayout" >API reference</ExternalLink>. Make sure you select _PayoutRequest_ to see the correct fields.

For a full walkthough, follow the instructions for our [payments endpoint](/payments/accept-payments/request-a-payment), and make sure you include the following fields.

## Collect platform fees

You collect your platform fees through the same method as making payouts to your sub-entities. The only difference is the `destination.id` field should be your platform's payment instrument ID. This will have been provided to you during your onboarding with <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/" >Checkout.com</ExternalLink>.
