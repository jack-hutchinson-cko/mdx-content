title: Quick start (full)

This guide demonstrates the full process, from onboarding a sub-entity to processsing payments on its behalf and later payout directly to their bank account.

## Before you begin

Check you've completed the following steps before starting your integration. 

- Your account is able to onboard sub-entities.
- You have your `client_id` and `client_secret`, so you can generate access tokens with the required scopes. See our [authentication workflow](/resources/api-authentication/o-auth-2-0-client-credentials) for more information.
- You have your processing channel ID, currency account and payment instrument IDs which will be required throughout the process.
- You have configured your webhooks and subscribed to the relevant events through our [Workflow API](/workflows). 
- You are familiar with our [account structure](/marketplaces/account-structure).

<TipBox variant="info">

Unless otherwise agreed during your onboarding, your sub-entities will undergo **full** onboarding (CSS, PEP, KYC and KYB checks). The **payments** and **payouts** capabilities will be enabled if the checks are passed.

</TipBox>

## Step 1: Onboard your sub-entities 

<tabs>
<tab title="Individual">

Vendors, retailers and service providers on your platform are represented by sub-entities in our solution. A sub-entity is used to collect the information we require to perform due diligence checks, as well as capture certain preferences.

In this step we’re going to walk through the complete onboarding of a sub-entity:

* Onboard with the minimum required information
* Upload identity documentation
* Keep up to date with webhook notifications

---

### Step 1a: Onboard a sub-entity

<TipBox variant="info">

To provide greater flexibility, we don’t need you to provide all of the data required for due diligence checks upfront. You can onboard a sub-entity with the minimum required information and then enrich it later through updates. We will trigger our checks only when we have all of the information required to conduct them. If our due diligence checks pass, payment and payout capabilities for this sub-entity will be enabled. Read more about this on our [onboarding information page](/marketplaces/onboarding).

</TipBox>

---

### Request

We will use the example of **Daniel’s Donuts**, a donut seller (who is a sole proprietor) on our fictional platform, Desserts Delivered. We will provide the minimum required fields for Daniel’s Donuts to start its onboarding!

Use <RequestTag type="post" />`/marketplace/entities`.

```json
{
  "reference":"0123456",
  "contact_details":{
    "phone":{
      "number":"2345678910"
    }
  },
  "profile":{
    "urls":[
      "https://www.daniels-donuts.com"
    ],
    "mccs":[
      5814
    ]
  },
  "individual":{
    "first_name":"Daniel",
    "last_name":"Yubi",
    "trading_name":"Daniel's Donuts",
    "national_tax_id":"1234567",
    "registered_address":{
      "address_line1":"90 Tottenham Court Road",
      "city":"London",
      "zip":"W1T4TJ",
      "country":"GB"
    }
  }
}
```

<TipBox variant="info">

- You will only be able to specify the `individual.registered_address.country`, `profile.mccs` and `profile.default_holding_currency` to those that were configured for your scope during onboarding.
- Note that `profile.default_holding_currency` of `GBP` means that payments processing on behalf of Daniel’s Donuts would be routed and held in the platform's GBP currency account.

</TipBox>

### Response

A successful response will include a unique sub-entity `id`, which you should store for future requests. Additionally, the response has the `capabilities` object, which shows you whether the sub-entity’s capabilities are enabled or not. Capabilities only get enabled once specific due diligence checks have been run and passed.

You will also notice there is a `status` field set to `requirements_due`. This is because we still require more information before we can conduct due diligence checks – in this case, it is the identification document.

```json
{
  "id":"ent_vv2jjkuf2gzj5tcw2x7ptua7zy",
  "reference":"0123456",
  "status": "requirements_due",
  "capabilities":{
    "payments":{
      "enabled":false
    },
    "payouts":{
      "enabled":false
    }
  },
 "requirements_due": [
	{
       "field": "individual.identification.document",
       "reason": "required"
    },
  ],
  "_links":{
    "self":{
      "href":"https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/marketplace/entities/ent_vv2jjkuf2gzj5tcw2x7ptua7zy"
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the `sub_entity_created` webhook notification will also be sent.

That’s all it takes to create a sub-entity!  

---

### Step 1b: Upload identity documentation

Use the `id` returned to upload an identification document. Find out how to do this using our [Files API](/marketplaces/onboarding/api/full/upload-a-file).

You then need to update the sub-entity with this identification document attached, so we trigger due diligence checks.

Read more about how to do this on our [onboarding page](/marketplaces/onboarding/api/full).

---

### Step 1c: Handle due diligence result and capability changes

Once we have conducted our due diligence checks, we will inform you of the outcome via [webhook notification](/workflows/webhook-event-types). You should expect to receive the `full_dd_passed` and `full_dd_failed` event types. Unless one of our `legal_name` fail triggers is used for simulation, due diligence will always pass in Sandbox.

For **Daniel’s Donuts**, we receive the `full_dd_passed` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "full_dd_passed",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
    "reference": "123456789101112",
    "legal_name": "Daniel Yubi"
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

If due diligence is passed, we will enable the sub-entity’s payment and payout capabilities. You should expect to receive the `payments_enabled` and `payouts_enabled` event types.

For **Daniel’s Donuts**, we receive the `payments_enabled` and payouts_enabled with the following payloads:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "payments_enabled",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
    "reference": "123456789101112",
    "legal_name": "Daniel Yubi"
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

<br />

```json
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "payouts_enabled",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
    "reference": "123456789101112",
    "legal_name": "Daniel Yubi"
  },

      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

<TipBox variant="info">

We will re-trigger due diligence checks if any of the required information is later updated. If any subsequent checks fail and you receive the `full_dd_failed` notification, which will be followed by `payments_disabled` and `payouts_disabled`.

}
```

Note that the `sub_entity_created` webhook notification will also be sent.

That’s all it takes to create a sub-entity!  

---

### Step 1b: Upload an identity document for representative of sub-entity

Use the `id` returned to upload an identification document. Find out how to do this using our [Files API](/marketplaces/onboarding/api/full/upload-a-file).

You then need to update the sub-entity with this identification documentz attached, so we trigger due diligence checks.

Read more about how to do this on our [onboarding page](/marketplaces/onboarding/api/full).

### Step 1c: Handle due diligence result and capabilities changes

Once we have conducted our due diligence checks, we will inform you of the outcome via webhook notification. You should expect to receive the `full_dd_passed` and `full_dd_failed` event types. Unless one of our `legal_name` fail triggers is used for simulation, due diligence will always pass in Sandbox. 

For **The Cake Shop**, we receive the `full_dd_passed` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "full_dd_passed",
  "version": "1.0.0",

      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

If due diligence is passed, we will enable the sub-entity’s **payment** and **payout** capabilities. You should expect to receive the `payments_enabled` and `payouts_enabled` event types.

For **The Cake Shop**, we receive the `payments_enabled` and `payouts_enabled` with the following payloads:

## Step 2: Accept payments

<tabs>
<tab title="Individual">

Now that your capabilities have been enabled, you’re ready to start using them. Our Unified Payments API enables you to process payments on behalf of a sub-entity by specifying its `id` in the `marketplace.sub_entity_id` field when using <RequestTag type="post" />`/payments`.

We’ll use **Daniel’s Donut's** `id` from step 1 to process a payment for £10 on its behalf.

<TipBox variant="info">

Funds will be routed and held in your platform’s currency accounts as per the preferences agreed for your platform during onboarding. In this example all payments are being routed to GBP.

## Step 3: Make payouts

<tabs>
<tab title="Individual">

Now that we’ve successfully processed a payment on behalf of our sub-entity, we now have funds available to be paid out to **Daniel’s Donuts**, as well as fees to collect for our platform, Desserts Delivered.

In this step we’re going to walk through the steps that will enable us to do this:

- Retrieve currency account balance
- Store sub-entity bank account details
- Make a payout
- Collect platform fees

---

### Step 3a: Retrieve currency account balance

We are currently working on exposing real-time currency account balances via API, and hope to offer this functionality soon. In the meantime, you can process [balance reports](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/balance-reports) to retrieve the closing available balance of your currency account(s) on a daily basis. If you’d like to reconcile transactions for each sub-entity, you can process daily [financial actions](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports) reports to retrieve this breakdown.

---

### Step 3b: Create sub-entity payment instrument

A payment instrument is a set of bank account details securely stored in our vault. You will need to create a payment instrument for your sub-entity so that it can later be used as a destination when making on-demand payouts directly to them.

<TipBox variant="note">

Your platform's bank account is also represented as a payment instrument, and will be used as the destination when making payouts to yourself to collect your platform’s fees. Your platform payment instrument ID(s) will be provided to you after we have completed your setup.

</TipBox>

We will create a payment instrument representing Daniel’s Donuts Barclays bank account details in this step. Use <RequestTag type="post" /> `/marketplace/entities/{id}/instruments` to create a sub-entity payment instrument.

---

### Request

<TipBox>

Grab the `file_id` in the same way you did for the identification document.

</TipBox>

```json
{
  "label":"Daniel's Donuts Barclays",
  "type":"bank_account",
  "account_number":"12345678",
  "bank_code":"050389",
  "currency":"GBP",
  "country":"GB",
  "account_holder":{
    "company_name":"Daniel's Donuts",
    "billing_address":{
      "address_line1":"90 Tottenham Court Road",
      "city":"London",
      "state":"London",
      "zip":"W1T 4TJ",
      "country":"GB"
    }
  }
}
```

We will attempt to create the payment instrument asynchronously (behind the scenes), and inform you of the result via the `payment_instrument_created` and `payment_instrument_error` webhook notifications. 

For **Daniel’s Donuts**, we receive the `payment_instrument_created` notification – this contains `data.payment_instrument_id`, which we’ll need to make our payout to Daniel’s Donuts later:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
  "type": "payment_instrument_created",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
  "data": {
    "sub_entity_id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
    "payment_instrument_id": "src_33z5qxrwp2bulj4volyqvarhyq",
    "label": "Daniel's Donuts Barclays"
  },
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
    }
  }
}
```

If successful, we will automatically make the association between this payment instrument and its sub-entity. You can see this association and alternatively retrieve the payment instrument `id` by using <RequestTag type="get" /> `/marketplace/entities/{id}` again:

```json
{
  "id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
  ...,
  "instruments": [
    {
      "id": "src_33z5qxrwp2bulj4volyqvarhyq",
      "label": "Daniel's Donuts Barclays"
    }
  ],
  ...,
}
```

---

### Step 3c: Make sub-entity payout

Similar to processing payments, our Unified Payments API enables you to make payouts on behalf of a sub-entity by specifying its `id` in the `marketplace.sub_entity_id` field when using <RequestTag type="post" /> `/payments`.

We’ll make a payout to **Daniel’s Donuts** for £8. The funds will come from Desserts Delivered’s GBP currency account (`source.id`) and be sent to Daniel’s Donuts bank account (`destination.id`).

---

### Request

```json
{
  "amount":100,
  "currency":"GBP",
  "source":{
    "type":"currency_account",
    "id":"ca_a4kf6by2guqelofnaa4uqozosu"
  },
  "destination":{
    "type":"id",
    "id":"src_sivtx4g4mt2u7h5eltcqm7d4fa"
  },
  "billing_descriptor":{
    "reference":"Desserts Delivered Payout"
  },
  "instruction":{
    "purpose":"Payout"
  },
  "processing_channel_id":"pc_v6oaskquunqufj2t7e7wf3e6am"
}
```

---

### Response

```json
{
  "id":"pay_xvyvcgxx7hmu3iw2kdfunegh3m",
  "status":"Pending",
  "instruction":{
    "value_date":"2021-03-31T01:39:57.0909438Z"
  },
  "_links":{
    "self":{
      "href":"https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_xvyvcgxx7hmu3iw2kdfunegh3m"
    },
    "actions":{
      "href":"https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_xvyvcgxx7hmu3iw2kdfunegh3m/actions"
    }
  }
}
```

The payout will be attempted asynchronously (behind the scenes) and you will be informed of updates to its status through webhook notifications. You should expect to receive the `payment_paid` event type.

For **Daniel’s Donuts**, we receive the `payment_paid` with the following payload:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_pktvel6mu4pe7ccp2fj2eptd5e",
  "type": "payment_paid",
  "created_on": "2020-04-22T08:59:10Z",
  "data": {

    "response_code": "10000",
    "response_summary": "Approved",
    "amount": 800,
    "currency": "GBP",
    "source": {

      "id": "ca_e6myfp3ubs3ulk5tve6xx6x2oy"
    },
    "destination": {
      "type": "id",
      "id": "src_33z5qxrwp2bulj4volyqvarhyq"
    },
    "processed_on": "2020-04-22T09:00:10Z",
    "reference": "Desserts Delivered Payout",
  },
 "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/events/evt_hbnxegj3dqyu5fsd4p2b4bxvpa"
    },
    "subject": {
      "href": "https://api.checkout.com/workflows/events/subject/pay_jlfj2ful7z3u5lbykhy5lzezvm"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Step 3d: Collect platform fees

Collection of your platform fees is achieved through the same method as making payouts to sub-entities. The only difference being that the `destination.id` will be your platform’s payment instrument `id`.

<TipBox variant="info">

In this example we (Desserts Delivered) will simply collect a £1 fee from **Daniel’s Donuts**; however, please note that because funds for multiple sub-entities are aggregated based on currency, you can actually collect fees from multiple sub-entities in a single request, which reduces the effort required. 

</TipBox>

Use <RequestTag type="post" /> `/payments` again, but this time you can omit the `marketplace` object, as this payout is being made on behalf of your platform to collect your fees. Instead use the payment instrument representing your bank account as the `destination.id`.

---

### Request

```json
{
  "amount": 100,
  "currency": "GBP",
  "source": {
    "type": "currency_account",
    "id": "ca_e6myfp3ubs3ulk5tve6xx6x2oy"
  },
  "destination": {
    "type": "id",
    "id": "src_otruwzxbhvhutpoheg4q5jmkgq"
  },
  "billing_descriptor": {
    "reference": "Desserts Delivered"
  },
  "processing_channel_id": "pc_q4dbxom5jbgudnjzjpz7j2z6uq",

### Response

```json

  "reference": "Desserts Delivered",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api.checkout.com/payments/pay_xlnpaqlov6ueva2usevmdvlupa"
    }
  }
}
```

The payout will be attempted asynchronously (behind the scenes) and you will be informed of updates to its status through webhook notifications. You should expect to receive the `payment_paid` event type.

For the payout to collect fees for Desserts Delivered, we receive the `payment_paid` with the following payload:

```json

## FAQs
 
<Accordion title="Why haven't my sub-entity's capabilities been enabled?">

Capabilities are enabled once due diligence checks have been completed. If you haven't received a webhoook notification – either `full_dd_passed` or `full_dd_failed` – it is likely there are outstanding requirements due. Please check our onboarding information page to confirm you have sent all the required information.

If you have provided all the information, and more than two hours have passed, please allow up to 48 hours to review the sub-entity. In rare cases, we may have to perform checks manually, which can delay our response.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is there an invalid scope error?">

You will only be able to specify the `company.principal_address.country`, `profile.mccs` and `profile.default_holding_currency` to those that were configured for your scope during onboarding. For example, if your processing scope is only MCC `5311`, you cannot change this to `5411`. If you’re getting an invalid for scope error, you’ll need change the value(s) to something in your scope, or get in touch with us to update your scope.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I didn't specify a default currency, but one was set anyway. Why?">

If omitted, `profile.default_holding_currency` will be set to the default preference specified during your onboarding.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why can't I update my sub-entity's default holding currency?">

`profile.default_holding_currency` is not currently updatable. If you need to change this, please get in touch.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is there a 'pay to bank not configured' error when attempting a payout?">

This means the processing channel you are using is not configured for pay to bank. Please use another one or get in touch to have it enabled on the one you’re using.

</Accordion>
