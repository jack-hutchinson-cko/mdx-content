## Initial Okta setup

This first section describes the preliminary steps you need to take as an Okta administrator in order to enable SSO for Checkout.com.

### Step 1: Create a Checkout.com application in Okta

1. Log in to your Okta admin portal with Super Admin rights.
2. In the top left corner, select _Classic UI_ to make sure all features are visible.
3. Select _Applications > Create New App > SAML 2.0 > Create_.
4. Fill the App Name field with `Checkout.com`.
5. Upload the following App Logo and select _Next_.

### Step 2: Configure the SAML settings

1. Set Single Sign On URL to `http://localhost` as a placeholder. Use this for the Recipient URL and Destination URL.
2. Set Audience URI to `http://localhost` as a placeholder.
3. Set Default Relay state to:
    - `https://dashboard.checkout.com` for production
    - `https://dashboard.sandbox.checkout.com` for sandbox
4. Set Name ID to `Unspecified`.
5. Set Application username to your Okta username.
6. Set Update application username on to Create and update.
7. Leave the Advanced SAML settings on their default values.
8. Set the Attribute statements as detailed below. These are mandatory attributes for the SAML assertion.

<Table>
<TableHead headers={['Name','Name format','Value']}/>
<TableBody>
<TableRow>
<TableCell>

`firstName`

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

`Unspecified`

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

`user.firstName`

</TableCell>
</TableRow>
<TableRow>
<TableCell>

`lastName`

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

`Unspecified`

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

`user.lastName`

</TableCell>
</TableRow>
<TableRow>
<TableCell>

`email`

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

`Unspecified`

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

`user.email`

</TableCell>
</TableRow>
</TableBody>
</Table>

9. Set the Groups statements required to propagate your IDP groups as part of the SAML assertion. This is needed to configure access rights by mapping your IDP groups to Checkout.com known roles. To propagate all groups:

<Table>
<TableHead headers={['Name','Name format','Value']}/>
<TableBody>
<TableRow>
<TableCell>

`idpGroups`

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

`Unspecified`

</TableCell>
<TableCell>

`Matches Regex .*`

</TableCell>
</TableRow>
</TableBody>
</Table>

<TipBox>

You can use a more restrictive group regex filter if you'd like.

</TipBox>

10. Select _Finish_ then _Next_ to complete the initial setup.

### Step 3: Extract the SSO configuration

1. Go back to the application’s _Sign-On_ tab and select _View Setup Instructions_.
2. Copy the _Identity Provider Single Sign-On_ URL.
3. Copy the _Identity Provider Issuer_.
4. Download the certificate.

### Step 4: Define group access rights

Checkout.com supports several types of users, all with difference levels of access. See [user roles](/dashboard/team-permissions) for a breakdown of each of these roles.

Create a `.json` file that defines a mapping between the propagated groups to Checkout.com’s known roles.

For example:

```json withBorder
{
  "ClientGroup1": "Owner",
  "ClientGroup2": "Admin",
  "ClientGroup3": "Read Only",
  "ClientGroup4": "Read Only"
}
```

### Step 5: Securely share your configuration with Checkout.com

You will be provided with a set of SFTP login credentials with which they will securely share the following configurations:

- Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL
- Identity Provider Issuer URL
- Certificate (`.crt` file)
- Mapping of IDP groups to roles (`.json` file)
- Corporate email domain(s) (e.g., `mycompany.com`, `mycompany.uk`)

Our Okta admin will then register your IDP with the above configuration and reach back to you to complete the setup.

## Final client Okta setup and testing

This section describes the final steps you need to take as an Okta administrator in order to configure SSO for Checkout.com.

### Step 1: Finalize the SAML settings

1. Go to the Checkout.com SAML application you previously created.
2. Select _General > SAML Settings > Edit > Next_.
3. Replace the placeholder values for the Single Sign-On URL and the Audience URI with the parameters we previously shared with you.
4. Select _Next_, then _Finish_.

### Step 2: Assign the Checkout.com application to users

1. Go back to the Checkout.com application and select _Assignments > Assign to Groups_.
2. Assign the groups defined in the previous steps to the application.

### Step 3: Test the two types of login

### To test the Okta end-user dashboard (IDP-initiated login):

1. While logged in as a permitted user, check that a Checkout.com application is visible on the corporate Okta dashboard.
2. Select the application. If everything is working correctly, it should authenticate you and redirect you to Checkout.com.

### To test the Checkout.com login page (SP-initiated login):

1. Go to either:
    - <ExternalLink href="https://dashboard.checkout.com">https://dashboard.checkout.com</ExternalLink> (production)
    - <ExternalLink href="https://dashboard.sandbox.checkout.com">https://dashboard.sandbox.checkout.com</ExternalLink> (sandbox)
2. Complete the email address field, then select _Next_. A Single-Sign On button is displayed.
3. Select it. If everything is working correctly, it should redirect to Checkout.com.
