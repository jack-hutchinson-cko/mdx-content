## The Home page

Home is the first thing you see when you log in to the Dashboard. It gives you a concise view of all your payments activity, allowing you to check how your business is doing at a glance.

Track and analyze your volume, refund and disputes metrics in real-time, and see a detailed breakdown of volume for each card type, payment method and currency you support.

<TipBox variant='info' title='Display currency and timezone'>

You cannot change the display currency from the default currency you chose when setting up your Checkout.com account. The timezone is determined by your internet browser settings, which will filter through to the reports in the *Datetime Local* column.

If you want to view older data, click _Date filter_ in the top right and then select a date or date range. To select a date range, click on the start date then click on the end date. Your selected date range will be highlighted in green.
