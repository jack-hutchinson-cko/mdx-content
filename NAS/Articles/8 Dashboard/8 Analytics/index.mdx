### Data type

When creating a chart, start by selecting the 'Data type' under the heading 'Chart data'. That data type should be the main metric that you would like to analyze. You can choose from count, amount, rates and calculation-based data types.

For example, if you would like to analyze your organization's authorizations, you can choose from either Authorized count or Authorized amount. Authorized count indicates the number of authorizations across the select range. Authorized amount indicates the total value of the authorizations.

### Group by

The _Group by_ selector under the _Chart data_ heading determines how you would like to measure your chosen data type. For example grouping by currency or card scheme.

If you do not use a group by, you will only view a specific number or rate for your data type. Select *+ Group by* to group by an additional dimension. Select *Remove* next to a group by to clear your group by selection.

### Limits

When you select your desired group by, you may be given the option to limit the data points. This is useful when you have a lot of data points and wish to limit the results shown on the chart.

<TipBox variant='note'>

The limit filter is not available when using the _Creation date_ and _Decline type_ group by selectors, or when more than one group by selectors have been applied.

</TipBox>

### Filter

Filtering let you be more specific with your data explorations. You can decide whether you want your chart to include (=) or not include (!=) your filter. You can add multiple filters by using the 'and' or 'or' operands.

### Chart types

As you start to select your variables, your chart will start to take shape. You can change how you want to view your data by selecting a chart type. The chart types available are depended on the _Data type_ and _Group by_ you have selected.

Charts are interactive â€“ meaning you can hover, highlight and zoom to dig deeper into your chart's data.

### Data range

Use the date picker to choose what time span you would like your chart's data to display. If you wish to see hourly data points for a particular day, select the date range of one day.

### Code viewer

## Boards

Boards are used to organize relevant charts in the same space for easy access. Create multiple boards to organize your charts and keep track of the metrics most important to you and your team members.

---

### My boards and shared boards

Boards can either be private for only you to see in your 'My boards' list, or shared for other members in your organization to view. This is set when you first create your board, but can also be changed at any time from your board's settings. When you make a board shared, the board will be available to access for users from within your entity.

<TipBox>

Making boards shared is a useful way to ensure that work is not duplicated across your team by letting other users have access to your board.

</TipBox>

---

### Preset boards

The Preset boards tab displays a list of example boards created by <ExternalLink href="https://www.checkout.com/" >Checkout.com</ExternalLink>, available to all users. Use these preset boards as inspiration to create your own, or to provide quick insight into your payments data without having to create a board yourself.

---

### Create new board

You can create a new board by either selecting a template or a blank board from the boards page. A board template is a board containing pre-made charts. After selecting a template, as with a blank board, you will then be able to adjust the board as you wish by editing, adding or deleting charts. A template provides a great starting point to create a board to suit your analytics needs.

You must enter a board title and decide whether you want your board to be shared or private before saving. These settings can be edited at any time in your board settings.

### Add widgets to your boards

When you have created a new board, you will need to add charts to start analyzing payments data.

Adding a chart to your board can be done in two ways:

1. After creating a chart in *Data explorer* and selecting *Save chart*.
2. Directly from the board by selecting *+ New widget / + New chart*.

When adding a chart directly from your board, you will be navigated through the Chart builder, just as you have seen in the Data explorer. When adding a chart directly from your board, you will be navigated through the 'Chart builder', just as you have seen in the 'Data explorer'.
