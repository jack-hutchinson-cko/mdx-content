At the end of a settlement cycle, we display a list of payments made to your account in the Dashboard. To view your settlements from the landing page, select _Settlements_ in the left-hand menu.

<TipBox title='How settlements are calculated' variant='info'>

We calculate the settlement amount by looking at the amounts processed during that period.

</TipBox>

The Settlements page shows a list of these settlements, ordered from the most recent (at the top of the page) to the oldest. For each settlement, you will see:

- Amount.
- Status: This will be `REJECTED`, `PENDING` or `COMPLETED`.
- Reference.
- Billing descriptor: This is the reference to the specific settlement, and what you will see on your bank statement. 
- Payout ID: You can use this ID as an additional identifier; however, this is given by Checkout.com and applies to us only.
- Settlement date: If the payment has not been settled yet, we indicate the expected date.

## Settlement details page

Navigate to the _Settlement details_ page by selecting a specific settlement from the main list. Here you’ll see more details about that payout, such as:

- What stages the settlement has been through.
- Bank account details.
- The balance day and time for that settlement.

## Transactions breakdown

At the bottom of the Settlement details page, you’ll see Transactions breakdown. Here you can download a report of [financial actions by payout ID](/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports), which gives a breakdown of transactions for that particular settlement.

We provide a lot of granular details in our report, so if the report is too big, we will break this down into several reports, so it’s more digestible.
