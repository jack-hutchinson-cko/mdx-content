The Payments screen shows you the full payment activity for your business, with your most recent payments displayed first. By default, each line corresponds to one payment. You can also see lists of payment actions by using the `action:` filter.

The following information is displayed for each payment:

- The amount (of the payment request) and the currency.
- The method, and the card number, if it applies.
- The date on which the request was made.
- The status:
    - If your payment is partially captured or partially refunded, the amount of the partial action is displayed in a tooltip when hovering over the information icon next to the status.
    - If the last action (capture, void or refund) on your payment failed, a `DECLINED` message will appear next to the action. You can see the response code and its meaning by hovering over the tooltip.

## View payment details

To view more information about a payment and the actions that have been taken against it, select a row. This will open a panel in which you can see a full list of actions related to that payment, with the most recent first, as well as customer, action and payment details.

Here, you can also capture, [void or refund a payment](#Capture,_void_or_refund_a_payment).
