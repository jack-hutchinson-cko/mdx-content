title: Balance reports
account: NAS
---

Balance reports provide you with a view of monetary inflows and outflows across your currency accounts, as well as the opening and closing available balances over a specified period of time.

This allows you to determine any actions you need to take on your currency accounts. For example, the transfer of funds between your currency accounts or balance top-ups.

Your balance report also provides a breakdown of total payment-related fees and account-level fees applied to your currency accounts, allowing you to see the net revenue paid out to you over a specified period of time across each of your entities.

---

## Understanding your balance report

Balance reports are available by entity and structured by currency account. For each of your currency accounts, the report features the following types of rows:

- **Balances & Payouts**: shows your currency account opening and closing balance, and financial activity not resulting from payments, such as account-level fees, adjustments, transfers and payouts.

- **Breakdown**: subsequent rows show a breakdown by payment method, including the total payment amount, total payment-related fees and tax. The number of rows depends on the number of payment methods processed to a currency account during the reporting period.

## Report format

Balance reports come in .csv format with the file name following this template: 

`statement_{Entity Id}_{Currency}_{Start Date:YYYYMMDD}_{End Date:YYYYMMDD}.csv`

---

## When are the reports available?

The balance report will be available from 12:00:00 UTC each day, and includes any fund movements across your currency accounts that took place between 00:00:00 UTC and 23:59:59 UTC the previous day.

For example, all fund movements on 3 August 2020 (from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 UTC) will be included in a daily balance report generated and available by 4 August 2020 at 12:00:00 UTC.

Your balance report can be made available on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.
