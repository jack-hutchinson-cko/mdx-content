title: Financial actions reports
account: NAS
---

Financial actions reports provide an accurate representation of all actions during a payment’s life-cycle that impact your currency account's available balance. Together with the payouts reports, you can reconcile payments and any associated fees against payouts paid out to you.

Understanding the financial impact of each action and any foreign exchange (FX) rates applied also allows you to accurately assess your cost of sale.

---

## Understanding your financial actions reports

The reports come in two forms:

- **Financial actions by date range**: contains financial actions across a specified time period.

- **Financial actions by payout ID**: contains financial actions related to a specific payout ID—useful when reconciling financial actions with a payout paid out to your bank account.

Every row features a unique financial action ID that can be linked to a specific payment, using the payment ID, or a settled payout, using the payout ID.

Both reports feature identical field names and list records chronologically.

## Report format

Financial actions reports come in .csv format with the file name following these templates:

- **Financial actions by date range**: 

`financialactions_{Your Entity-ID}_{Start Date Range:YYYYMMDD}_{End Date Range:YYYYMMDD}_1.csv`

- **Financial actions by payout ID**: 

`financialactions_{Your Entity-ID}_{Payout date: YYYYMMDD}_{PayoutID}_1.csv`

## When are my reports available?

The availability of your reports depends on the type of financial action report available to you.

### Financial actions by date range

These reports are available from 12:00:00 UTC and include any financial actions that impacted your available balance between 00:00:00 UTC and 23:59:59 UTC the previous day.

For example, all financial actions that occur on August 3rd, 2020 (from 00:00:00 UTC to 23:59:59 UTC) will be included in the daily financial actions by date range report generated and available from August 4th, 2020 at 12:00:00 UTC.

Financial actions by date range can be made available on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.

### Financial actions by payout ID

These reports are available from 16:00:00 UTC. The data includes any financial actions that have impacted your available balance and are linked to a payout from a currency account between 00:00:00 UTC and 23:59:59 UTC on the same day.

For example, for a payout made on August 3rd, 2020, financial actions linked to payments associated with the payout will be included in the financial actions by payout ID report available on August, 3rd 2020 at 16:00:00 UTC.
