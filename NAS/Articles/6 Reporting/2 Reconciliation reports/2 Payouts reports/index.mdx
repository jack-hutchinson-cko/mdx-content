title: Payouts reports
account: NAS
---

Payouts reports provide an overview of payouts paid to you along with a breakdown of the associated fees over a specific period of time. This allows you to reconcile payouts with amounts paid out to your bank account and shown on bank statements.

Using the payouts and the financial actions reports together, you can reconcile payouts with the associated payments and fees by using the payout ID on both reports.

---

## Understanding your payouts reports

Payouts reports are available for each entity. Each row on the report shows a payout from a currency account, and for each payout the total amount paid out to you, aggregated fees applied to payments processed (for example, interchange fees), and any account level fees applied to the payout (for example, merchant payout fees) are shown.

---

## Report format

Payouts reports come in .csv format with the file name following this template:

`payouts_{Entity ID}_{Start Date:YYYYMMDD}_{End Date:YYYYMMDD}_1.csv`

---

## When are the reports available?

These reports are available from 12:00:00 UTC each day, and the data includes any payouts from your currency accounts that took place between 12:00:00 UTC and 23:59:59 UTC the previous day.

For example, all payouts paid out to you on 3 August 2020 (from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 UTC) will be included in a daily payouts report generated and available by 4 August 2020 at 12:00:00 UTC.

Your payouts reports can be made available on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
